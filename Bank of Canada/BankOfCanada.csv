1999-03-31,"The Bank of Canada today lowered its Bank Rate by of one per cent to 5 per cent. The associated operating band for overnight interest rates was similarly reduced. The Bank's target for the overnight rate is now 4 per cent, the centre of the new operating band. Today's interest rate reduction was taken in the context of continued improvement in global financial markets and recent evidence that the trend rate of inflation in Canada is close to the lower end of the Bank's target range of 1 to 3 per cent. This action by the Bank of Canada, along with three similar reductions in September, October, and November, completely reverses the one percentage point increase in short term interest rates that was needed to bolster investor confidence last August, at a time of nervous and volatile international markets. This final step in unwinding the interest rate increase of last August is also consistent with keeping the trend rate of inflation inside the target range. Notwithstanding the recent good set of economic indicators, the competitive global environment and the absence of any signs of pressure on domestic production capacity point to continued low inflation in Canada. The Bank's semi annual Monetary Policy Report, which will be released in mid May, will present a full analysis of the outlook for inflation. Background Information With the introduction on 4 February of the new Large Value Transfer System for making large value payments, the implementation of monetary policy has changed slightly. There is still an operating band of of one percentage point for the overnight rate. The top of the band, the Bank Rate, is the rate charged by the Bank on LVTS overdraft loans to financial institutions. The bottom of the band is the interest rate the Bank of Canada pays on any LVTS balances held overnight by those institutions. The Bank has a target for the overnight rate, which has been set at the centre of the operating band. With the interest rate reduction announced today, the operating band has been reduced by of one percentage point to a new range of 4 to 5 per cent. The Bank's target rate for the overnight rate is 4 per cent. It is through the market for overnight funds that monetary policy exerts a direct effect on financial markets generally."
1999-05-04,"The Bank of Canada today lowered its Bank Rate by of one per cent to 4 per cent. The associated operating band for overnight interest rates was similarly reduced. The Bank's target for the overnight rate is now 4 per cent, the centre of the new operating band. The situation in international financial markets has improved considerably in recent months however, there are still significant uncertainties facing the global economy. Economic growth in the United States continues to exceed expectations, but price and cost pressures in the U.S. economy continue to be contained by productivity gains and a competitive global environment. Inflation remains subdued worldwide. In Canada, economic activity has been showing signs of increased upward momentum, and domestic financial markets have taken a more positive tone. At the same time, the trend of inflation has remained at the lower end of the Bank of Canada's 1 to 3 per cent target range. Given the economic and financial backdrop, this interest rate reduction by the Bank will help to provide monetary conditions that would support continued economic expansion and keep the trend of inflation comfortably inside the target range next year."
1999-11-17,"The Bank of Canada today raised its Bank Rate by of one percentage point to 5 per cent. The operating band for overnight interest rates was correspondingly increased, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is now 4 per cent. This action follows the decision yesterday by the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise its target level for the federal funds rate to 5 per cent. The Federal Reserve indicated that the expansion of activity in the U.S. economy continues in excess of its growth potential and expressed concern about the inflation risk. Given the implications of U.S. economic and financial developments for Canada, together with the recent evidence of robust domestic demand growth, this increase in interest rates by the Bank is designed to keep inflation well within the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent target range. In this way monetary policy continues to support a sustainable rate of growth in output and employment in Canada. The Bank's November Monetary Policy Report , to be published today, describes in detail the Bank's assessment of the trends in the economy over the next 18 months and the importance of taking timely action to preserve Canada's low inflation environment."
2000-02-03,"The Bank of Canada raised its Bank Rate today by of one percentage point to 5 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate was correspondingly increased, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is now 5 per cent. This increase in interest rates by the Bank, which follows the decision yesterday by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to raise its target level for the federal funds rate to 5 per cent, is designed to keep the future trend of inflation well inside the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent target range so that the Canadian economy can continue to expand in a sustainable way. The factors behind this decision include the strong momentum of demand in the Canadian economy from both external and domestic sources, the importance of approaching the economy's full capacity in a prudent way, and the risk of a spillover of potential inflation pressures from the United States into Canada. U.S. economic and financial developments have an important impact on Canada, and the Bank gives full and careful consideration to that influence. Decisions by the Bank, however, are always taken on the basis of what is considered appropriate for the situation in Canada. The Bank will be issuing an Update to its November Monetary Policy Report in two weeks. That Update , to be included in the Bank of Canada's Winter Review , will provide a current assessment of the trends in the economy."
2000-03-22,"The Bank of Canada raised its Bank Rate today by of one percentage point to 5 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate was correspondingly increased, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is now 5 per cent. This increase in interest rates by the Bank of Canada follows the decision yesterday by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to raise its target level for the federal funds rate to 6 per cent. In announcing its decision, the Federal Reserve expressed further concern that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth of the U.S. economy's production capacity, posing inflation risks. Strong U.S. demand has been benefiting the Canadian export sector. Increased export sales, together with the robust momentum of domestic spending in Canada, have led to a more rapid economic expansion than expected. While the core measure of Canadian inflation remains in the lower half of the Bank's inflation control target range of 1 to 3 per cent, the strengthening pace of economic expansion has been rapidly absorbing production capacity and runs the risk of putting excessive pressure on capacity limits. In addition, the recent sharp rise in energy prices has pushed the increase in the total CPI to 2.7 per cent and is adding to input costs for other products. This adjustment in the Bank Rate is designed to resist any tendency for these developments to lead to an increase in the trend of inflation in Canada. It is by taking timely action, as required, to keep future inflation inside the 1 to 3 per cent target range that the Bank of Canada can help to ensure a sustainable expansion of economic activity and employment."
2000-05-17,"The Bank of Canada raised its target for the overnight rate by one half of one percentage point to 5 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate was correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 6 per cent. In its latest Monetary Policy Report, released last week, the Bank took note of the strength of demand in Canada from both international and domestic sources, some early signs of pressures on capacity limits, and the need to lean against these trends in order to preserve the low and stable inflation environment that has been benefiting the Canadian economy. An important source of this strong growth in demand has been the U.S. economy. Yesterday s action by the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise its target level for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points underscores the strength of that economy and the continued risk of demand and inflation pressures spilling over from the United States into Canada. This move by the Bank of Canada reflects the judgment that a tightening in monetary conditions in Canada is warranted, given that the underlying momentum of demand growth and the high levels of activity risk putting excessive pressure on the economy s capacity limits, and thus on inflation. It is through the Bank s commitment to a low and stable inflation environment that monetary policy can best contribute to sustained economic expansion in Canada, which will increase the likelihood of lower unemployment and improved productivity."
2000-12-05,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining the Bank Rate at 6 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate remains at 5 3/4 per cent. In making this decision, the Bank took into account a number of factors bearing on the future trend of inflation. Economic data continue to indicate that the rate of expansion of output is above the Canadian economy's long run growth potential. While external demand for Canadian products has moderated, reflecting the recent slowing in the United States economy, growth in domestic demand remains robust. The latest information on consumer price inflation was broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. In October, core inflation moved up slightly to 1.5 per cent, remaining in the lower half of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation control target range. The rate of increase in the total consumer price index remained close to the top end of the target range, reflecting the sharp increase in energy prices over the past year. Monetary conditions have supported the growth of aggregate demand, and pressures on the economy's production capacity are expected to increase. At the same time, as pointed out in the November Monetary Policy Report , the economy's ability to expand without generating rising inflationary pressures could be greater than estimated. Accordingly, the Bank will continue to assess carefully the balance of aggregate demand and supply in the economy and the risks to the future trend of inflation. The Bank will also pay close attention to any signs that higher energy prices are being passed through to other prices in the economy and to inflation expectations, as well as to any potential inflationary effect from the lower Canadian dollar. In the Bank's judgment, the factors at work in the economy point to core inflation rising to the midpoint of the target range over the coming year."
2001-01-23,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering the Bank Rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 5 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is reduced to 5 1/2 per cent. The Bank's action was taken in light of a number of considerations bearing on the Canadian economic outlook and the future trend of inflation, in particular the slowdown in the United States. Over recent months the underlying momentum of the Canadian economy has remained solid, bolstered by stronger than expected growth in domestic demand, and the economy has been operating close to full capacity. Information on consumer price inflation for December released last week indicates that core inflation, at 1.9 per cent, has moved up near the midpoint of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation control target range sooner than expected. The rate of increase in the total CPI has remained above the top end of the target range, reflecting the large increases in energy prices over the past year. Recent information indicates that the outlook for the U.S. economy has weakened more abruptly than had been anticipated. This development, together with other information received since the Bank's Monetary Policy Report last November, suggests that growth in Canadian output this year is likely to slow to a rate close to potential growth, whereas three months ago economic growth was expected to be above potential. In the Bank's judgment, today's interest rate reduction will help maintain a balance between aggregate demand and supply in the economy and keep core inflation near the 2 per cent midpoint of the target range. The Bank projects that inflation measured by the total CPI will move down to a rate close to core inflation in the second half of this year, on the assumption that world energy prices stabilize at or below present levels. Given current uncertainties, the Bank will continue to closely watch evolving domestic and external economic developments with a view to preserving the low inflation environment that has benefited the Canadian economy."
2001-03-06,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering the Bank Rate by one half of one percentage point to 5 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is reduced to 5 per cent. Since 23 January, the Bank's last fixed announcement date, there have been indications that the slowdown in the U.S. economy in the first half of 2001 could be more pronounced than expected, and there is a risk that weakening confidence could delay the U.S. recovery. In Canada, recent information suggests that the positive underlying momentum in the economy at the end of 2000 was somewhat less strong than had been previously estimated, and that pressures on productive capacity and inflation are lower as a result. Today's action was taken in light of these developments and related uncertainties. The reduction in interest rates, together with rising disposable incomes bolstered by recent tax reductions, will help to underpin domestic demand. The Bank remains of the view that the overall pace of economic activity in Canada will rebound in the second half of the year. This will lead to a level of economic activity that is consistent with maintaining the core rate of inflation close to 2 per cent, the midpoint of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation control target range. Assuming that world energy prices remain around current levels, the Bank continues to expect that the annual rate of increase in the total CPI will move down to about 2 per cent in the second half of this year."
2001-04-17,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering the Bank Rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 5 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate 1 is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank's target for the overnight rate is reduced to 4 3/4 per cent. Since late 2000, the pace of economic expansion in Canada has slowed to a rate below the economy's long run growth potential. Information received since 6 March, the Bank's last fixed announcement date, confirms that this slowing is broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. The slowdown has largely been a consequence of the marked easing in the pace of U.S. economic growth, while final domestic demand has maintained its underlying momentum. Overall, the Canadian economy is expected to be operating somewhat below capacity by the middle of 2001, putting downward pressure on inflation. Core inflation, currently 2 per cent, is thus expected to ease. The rate of increase in the total CPI, currently close to 3 per cent, is expected to move down to 2 per cent by the end of 2001. In light of the slowing pace of growth and the movement towards a position of excess supply, today's interest rate reduction, together with earlier reductions announced in January and March, is intended to support growth in aggregate demand, consistent with the Bank's policy objective of keeping inflation close to the midpoint of its 1 to 3 per cent target range over the medium term. It remains the Bank's view that, following the slowdown in the first half of this year, Canada's economic growth will strengthen in the second half and in 2002. This expected pickup reflects a number of factors, including completion of the current inventory adjustment, continuing investment in new technology, recent tax cuts, the easing in domestic monetary conditions and, most importantly, the resumption of stronger U.S. economic growth. Given the uncertainties related to the timing and strength of the U.S. rebound, the Bank will continue to monitor developments closely."
2001-10-23,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate 1 by three quarters of one percentage point to 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 per cent. Over the course of the summer, a more pronounced weakening trend in economic activity became evident in Canada and globally. The terrorist attacks of 11 September appear to have exacerbated this trend. As a consequence, levels of economic activity in Canada through the second half of this year and the first half of next year will be further below the economy's potential output than previously expected. This will result in persistent downward pressure on inflation through much of next year. Core inflation, which was 2.3 per cent in September, is now expected to move down below 2 per cent in early 2002. Total CPI inflation, which was 2.6 per cent in September, should also decline below 2 per cent by early 2002, if energy prices remain at or below their early September levels. Today's interest rate cut, which brings the total reduction in policy interest rates since the beginning of the year to 3 percentage points, is intended to underpin confidence and provide additional support for domestic demand growth through 2002, consistent with keeping inflation near the Bank's target of 2 per cent over the medium term. In this environment of exceptional uncertainties about geopolitical developments and business and household confidence, the Bank will continue to monitor economic developments very closely."
2002-01-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/4 per cent. In the November Monetary Policy Report , the Bank indicated that the timing and extent of the recovery in economic activity in Canada this year would depend on geopolitical developments and the pace of the return of consumer and business confidence to normal levels. Since then, uncertainty has been reduced as geopolitical developments have evolved positively and consumer confidence has improved. However, business confidence both in Canada and abroad remains weak. Although the Canadian economy is expected to gather momentum in the course of this year, it will nonetheless remain in excess supply through 2002, putting downward pressure on inflation. Core inflation, which declined to 1.7 per cent in November, is likely to stay around its current level through mid 2002 and to average just under 1 1/2 per cent in the second half of the year. Total CPI inflation, which fell sharply to 0.7 per cent in November, is expected to remain below the core rate until late 2002. The interest rate cut announced today brings the cumulative easing in the target for the overnight rate over the past 12 months to 3 3/4 percentage points. This easing, together with the improvement in the overall economic climate, should underpin growth through 2002 and 2003. The outcome would be consistent with returning inflation to its 2 per cent target over the medium term."
2002-03-05,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 1/4 per cent. Information received since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 15 January indicates that the overall pace of economic activity in Canada and the United States has been stronger than expected, confirming that a recovery is underway. Canadian consumer price data for January show core inflation at 1.8 per cent and total CPI inflation at 1.3 per cent. The substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy continues to support economic growth in Canada, consistent with returning inflation to its 2 per cent target over the medium term. While uncertainties remain, the Bank expects the economy to gather strength as the year progresses."
2002-04-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent. The accumulated information since the beginning of the year continues to indicate stronger than expected economic growth in Canada and the United States. A robust recovery appears to be underway in Canada. At the same time, there are uncertainties with respect to the continued strength of household spending, the timing and strength of the recovery in business fixed investment, and the implications for the global economy of recent developments in the Middle East. In February, core inflation rose to 2.2 per cent, somewhat above the level projected for the next few months. Total CPI inflation was 1.5 per cent. With today's interest rate increase, the Bank is modestly reducing the amount of monetary stimulus in the economy. Substantial monetary stimulus remains in place to support continuing economic growth. This is consistent with keeping inflation at its 2 per cent target over the medium term. Details of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be presented in the Monetary Policy Report , to be published on 24 April 2002."
2002-06-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 2 3/4 per cent. Information received since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 16 April indicates that the economic recovery in Canada has been somewhat stronger than anticipated. And core inflation in April rose to 2.2 per cent, slightly above the level that had been projected. Total CPI inflation was 1.7 per cent. Today's interest rate increase represents a further reduction in the substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy. Going forward, with the economy showing strong momentum and moving back towards full production capacity more quickly than had been expected, the Bank will take the action necessary to keep inflation at its 2 per cent target over the medium term. This will contribute to sustaining economic activity at full capacity."
2002-07-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 per cent. Since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 4 June, the economic recovery in Canada has remained stronger than expected and has broadened across sectors. This momentum has been reflected in continued strong growth in employment and spending by households, as well as in some pickup of investment in machinery and equipment. As a result, the economy has been moving towards full production capacity more quickly than anticipated. Core inflation, which was 2.2 per cent in May, has remained a little higher than projected. There are both positive and negative risks to the Canadian economic outlook. On the positive side, with considerable monetary stimulus in the economy, growth in Canada could very well continue to exceed expectations. On the negative side, the main risk is the marked uncertainty associated with recent global corporate and financial market developments and their potential effects on confidence and world economic growth. The Bank's decision to raise interest rates represents a further measured reduction in the substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy. In the period ahead, the Bank will remain focused on taking the necessary actions to achieve the inflation target of 2 per cent over the medium term."
2002-09-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 per cent. Consistent with the Bank's economic outlook in the July Monetary Policy Report Update , the Canadian economy continued its strong performance in the second quarter of the year and into the summer. Also, both core inflation and total CPI inflation in July were broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. Stronger than expected growth in domestic demand in Canada continues, buoyed by the substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy. However, near term prospects for growth in the United States and the major overseas economies appear to have weakened somewhat. There is also increased uncertainty associated with global financial market volatility and the unsettled geopolitical situation. Taking these factors into consideration, the Bank has decided to leave its target for the overnight rate unchanged at this time. Looking forward, it remains the Bank's view that, as the Canadian economy continues to expand and to approach its production capacity, further measured reductions in monetary stimulus will be necessary in order to achieve the inflation control target of 2 per cent over the medium term."
2002-10-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 per cent. The strong expansion of the Canadian economy is continuing, with domestic demand growth fuelled by the substantial monetary stimulus in the economy. Core and total CPI inflation have risen appreciably above the Bank's 2 per cent target for inflation control, largely because of a number of relative price movements. At the same time, the outlook for global economic activity has weakened, reflecting uncertainty about economic, financial, and geopolitical developments, as well as a reduced tolerance for risk in global financial markets. These uncertainties and the weaker global outlook may dampen growth in aggregate demand for Canadian output in the near term. The Bank has therefore decided to leave the target for the overnight rate unchanged at this time. It remains the Bank's view, going forward, that timely removal of monetary stimulus will be required to achieve the inflation target over the medium term. The pace of monetary policy tightening will depend on unfolding economic, financial, and geopolitical developments and their implications for pressures on capacity and inflation in Canada. Particular attention will be paid to ensuring that the relative price movements that are causing inflation to rise do not feed into expectations of generalized price inflation. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation that were the basis for today's interest rate decision will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report , to be published on 23 October 2002."
2002-12-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 per cent. Core and total CPI inflation have remained above the Bank's 2 per cent target for inflation control, largely as a result of one off price movements such as the increase in insurance premiums. The Canadian economy continues to expand, with the substantial amount of monetary stimulus in the economy supporting growth in domestic demand. However, data that have become available since the Bank's last fixed announcement date on 16 October indicate that Canada's economic growth in the second half of 2002 is coming in lower than previously expected, primarily because of continuing financial and geopolitical uncertainties and global economic weakness. In these circumstances, the Bank has left the overnight rate unchanged. The Bank continues to expect a strengthening of domestic and foreign demand and the resumption of above potential growth in the second half of 2003. Accordingly, timely removal of monetary stimulus will be required to achieve the inflation target over the medium term. The pace of monetary policy tightening will depend on economic, financial, and geopolitical developments and their implications for pressures on capacity and inflation in Canada. Assuming crude oil prices remain at current levels, total inflation will likely peak at a lower level than previously expected, before returning to around 2 per cent in the second half of next year. The Bank will continue to monitor developments closely for any signs that the recent one off price movements may be feeding into expectations of generalized price inflation."
2003-03-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/4 per cent. Consumer price data since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 21 January indicate that both core and total CPI inflation remain well above the Bank's 2 per cent inflation target. Persistent above target inflation rates over the past few months reflect not only the impact of higher than expected crude oil and natural gas prices, but also continuing increases in auto insurance premiums and price pressures in certain sectors such as housing, food, and some services. More broadly, as noted in the January 2003 Monetary Policy Report Update , the fact that relative price increases are having a large impact on measures of trend inflation reflects an underlying firmness in the price setting environment. Economic growth in Canada moderated in the final three months of 2002, largely because of weaker exports, most notably a decline in automotive shipments to the United States. However, final domestic demand, particularly household expenditure, continued to expand at a robust pace. Owing to upward revisions to measures of Canadian economic growth in previous quarters, the level of economic activity at the end of 2002 was slightly higher than had been expected. Accordingly, the level of economic activity in Canada remains near full production capacity. In these circumstances, the persistence of above target rates of inflation has elevated the risk of an increase in inflation expectations. Significant geopolitical and global economic uncertainties continue to overhang the short run economic outlook. Nonetheless, the Bank continues to expect demand for Canadian output to pick up in the second half of 2003 and into 2004, as global uncertainties diminish. In light of domestic inflation pressures, the expectation that Canadian economic activity will remain near potential in 2003, the stimulative stance of monetary policy, and improved conditions in capital markets, the Bank has decided to raise the target for the overnight rate. As indicated in the MPR Update , further reductions in monetary stimulus will be required to return inflation to the target over the medium term. The timing and pace of increases in policy interest rates will continue to depend on a number of considerations. These include the strength of demand pressures, the evolution of inflation expectations, the impact on confidence of geopolitical and global economic uncertainties, and the way in which developments in the Middle East affect demand and inflation, both globally and in Canada. The Bank will continue to monitor closely all these factors."
2003-04-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 3 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/2 per cent. Since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 4 March, both core and total CPI inflation have remained well above the Bank's 2 per cent inflation target and measures of inflation expectations have edged up. Economic growth in Canada in the second half of 2002 and in early 2003 eased from its earlier vigorous pace, but domestic demand has remained firm and employment gains have continued. As a result, the level of economic activity in Canada remains near full production capacity. The near term outlook for the global and Canadian economies is somewhat weaker than was expected at the time of the Bank's last interest rate announcement. Nonetheless, with geopolitical uncertainties diminishing and world oil prices declining significantly, the risks confronting the global economy are now better balanced. The Bank thus expects that economic expansion in Canada and the United States will begin to strengthen towards the end of 2003 and will strengthen further in 2004. In view of the domestic inflation environment and the expectation that the Canadian economy will be operating near potential in 2004, the Bank has decided to further reduce the amount of monetary stimulus by raising the target for the overnight rate. In light of near term economic uncertainties, the Bank will be closely monitoring domestic demand and the inflation environment, as well as the pace of recovery in the United States and the overseas economies. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report , to be published on 23 April 2003."
2003-06-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 1/2 per cent. Data released since the Bank's last interest rate announcement indicate that both core and total CPI inflation declined in April more than expected. Some of this decline was due to transitory factors, most notably the rebate on electricity prices in Ontario. The Canadian economy continued to expand in the first quarter of 2003, reflecting firmness in domestic demand. This was broadly in line with expectations in the April Monetary Policy Report . More recent developments bearing on aggregate demand for Canadian output, including continuing weakness in the U.S. and global economies and concerns about the economic impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS , point to the likelihood of some near term softness in the Canadian economy. There has also been significant adjustment in the value of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, including the Canadian dollar. Looking forward, it remains the Bank's view that growth in the Canadian economy will be underpinned by the underlying strength of domestic demand and by the expected rebound in the U.S. economy towards the end of 2003 and through 2004. And, while there is likely to be some increase in core inflation in the coming months as a result of the unwinding of the transitory factors mentioned above, it now appears that both core and total CPI inflation will return to the 2 per cent target somewhat earlier than the Bank expected in April. In these circumstances, the Bank has decided to leave its policy interest rates unchanged. The Bank will monitor closely inflation developments, the strength of domestic demand, and signs of recovery in the U.S. and global economies, and will continue to assess the effects of the appreciation of the Canadian dollar on aggregate demand and price levels in Canada. An update of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be provided in the July Monetary Policy Report Update ."
2003-07-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/4 per cent. In recent months, there have been a number of unanticipated developments that bear on the outlook for inflation and economic activity in Canada. Both inflation and inflation expectations have declined more rapidly than the Bank had expected. Near term domestic economic activity has been undercut by the effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS and an isolated case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy BSE in Canada. Foreign demand for Canadian products has also been weaker than earlier anticipated. In addition, the rapid and sizable appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. currency will tend to have a dampening effect on the demand for tradable Canadian goods and services. In this context, inflation pressures have eased and more economic slack is opening up in Canada than was previously projected. Today's interest rate reduction will provide support for domestic demand growth, and consequently for levels of aggregate demand consistent with keeping inflation on a track to meet the 2 per cent target over the medium term. Looking ahead, the Bank still expects that growth in the Canadian economy will strengthen towards the end of 2003 and through 2004, underpinned by domestic demand, by the favourable conditions in capital markets, and by the anticipated rebound in the U.S. economy. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report Update , to be released this Thursday, 17 July."
2003-09-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 per cent. Since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 15 July, inflation pressures have continued to ease. Core inflation has declined below the 2 per cent inflation target earlier than the Bank anticipated, and it appears that lower inflation will persist over the coming months. As expected, economic growth was interrupted in the second quarter of the year, and the pace of growth in the third quarter will likely remain below potential. This recent weakness reflects the impact of a number of near term factors such as severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS , the effect of an isolated case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE on exports of Canadian beef and cattle, the power blackout in Ontario, and the forest fires in Western Canada. Notwithstanding these developments, there are clear indications that conditions are in place for a strengthening of economic growth. Final domestic demand growth has remained robust and the adverse effects of the near term factors are beginning to dissipate. The economic rebound in the United States began earlier, and will be stronger, than previously expected. As well, the tone of capital markets remains favourable. Overall, despite current weakness, the accumulation of economic evidence to date reinforces the Bank's view that growth in the Canadian economy will strengthen towards the end of 2003 and through 2004. With today's decision, policy interest rates will support the return to levels of economic activity consistent with achieving an overall balance of aggregate demand and supply and thus keeping inflation near the target over the medium term."
2003-10-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 per cent. Since the Bank lowered policy interest rates on 3 September, indicators of economic activity and inflation in Canada have evolved broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. Core inflation has remained below the Bank's 2 per cent inflation target. As well, there has been evidence of gathering economic strength, including firm growth in final domestic demand and positive signs of recovery in the U.S. and overseas economies. Over this period, however, the value of the U.S. dollar has depreciated more than was generally expected against some major currencies, including the Canadian dollar. Taking all these developments into account, the Bank has decided to leave its policy interest rates unchanged at this time. Looking forward, the Bank continues to expect growth in the Canadian economy to strengthen during the fourth quarter of 2003 and through 2004. On balance, this expansion should be above the rate of potential growth, supported by solid household spending and increased business investment. Stronger economic growth abroad should also boost foreign demand for Canadian goods and services, although this source of strength will be tempered by the higher value of the Canadian dollar. More broadly, there are uncertainties related to the timing and magnitude of ongoing global demand, price, and exchange rate adjustments to economic imbalances. The Bank will closely monitor and assess the implications of these global adjustments for demand and inflation in Canada. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the economy and the outlook for inflation will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report to be released on 22 October 2003."
2004-01-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 3/4 per cent. Both core and total CPI inflation remain below the 2 per cent inflation target. While inflation is exhibiting some volatility, underlying price pressures and the presence of spare capacity point to a core rate of inflation that will likely persist below the inflation target late into 2005. Despite stronger global economic growth, the rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. currency has cut into the overall growth of aggregate demand for Canadian goods and services through weaker exports and increased imports. In addition, although employment growth has continued to be vigorous, recent indicators of domestic demand in the fourth quarter of 2003 have been somewhat weaker than projected. As a consequence, the output gap at the end of 2003 appears to be somewhat larger than the Bank was expecting. In light of these demand and inflation factors, and the likelihood that they will persist through this year and into 2005, the Bank has decided to lower the target for the overnight rate to provide additional support for growth in aggregate demand and thus help return inflation to the target over the medium term. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the outlook for inflation, the economy, and the uncertainties surrounding aggregate demand growth will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report Update , to be released on 22 January 2004."
2004-03-02,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent. Information received since the Bank's last interest rate announcement has been broadly consistent with the economic outlook presented in the January Monetary Policy Report Update . As expected, core and total CPI inflation in January moved significantly below the 2 per cent inflation target. While external demand has been slightly stronger and final domestic demand in Canada slightly weaker than expected, the Bank's outlook remains, on balance, unchanged. In this context, today's decision to provide some additional monetary stimulus was taken to support aggregate demand and to return inflation to the target by the end of 2005. The Bank will monitor closely the evolution of external and domestic demand and the pressures on inflation, as the economy adjusts to global changes."
2004-04-13,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/4 per cent. The Canadian economy continues to adjust to developments in the global economy. These include stronger world demand, higher commodity prices, the realignment of world currencies, including the Canadian dollar, and the intensified competition, together with the new trading opportunities, coming from emerging market economies. These developments require shifts in activity among sectors and create a need for adjustments by many businesses. Monetary policy is facilitating these adjustments by supporting aggregate demand, with the goal of keeping the economy near its full potential and inflation on target. The Bank's outlook for economic growth and inflation remains essentially unchanged from the outlook published in the January Monetary Policy Report Update . The economy is projected to return close to its production potential by the third quarter of 2005 and core inflation is projected to move back to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2005. Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to lower the target for the overnight rate by a further quarter percentage point. The risks to the outlook now appear balanced. An elaboration of the Bank's views on the outlook for inflation and the economy will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report , to be released on 15 April 2004."
2004-06-08,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 1/4 per cent. Economic information received since the release of the April Monetary Policy Report MPR has been generally consistent with the Bank's expectations for growth and core inflation, and reflects the Canadian economy's continuing adjustment to global economic developments. The notable exception has been the sharp rise in world oil prices in response to stronger than anticipated global demand for oil and to heightened geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle East. This implies that total CPI inflation over the next several months will be higher than the Bank expected. All things considered, the Bank's outlook for economic growth and core inflation is essentially unchanged from the outlook in the April MPR . The Bank continues to project that the economy will return close to its production potential by the third quarter of 2005 and that core inflation will move back to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2005. In these circumstances, the Bank decided to leave the target for the overnight rate unchanged."
2004-07-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 1/4 per cent. The Bank's outlook for economic growth and core inflation in Canada is little changed from the April Monetary Policy Report . The Canadian economy is judged to be operating slightly closer to full production capacity than had been anticipated in April and is now expected to be at its production potential by mid 2005. Core inflation is still projected to move back up to the 2 per cent inflation target by the end of 2005. However, the short term projection for total CPI inflation has been raised to reflect higher than expected world oil prices. Against this background, the Bank decided to leave the target for the overnight rate unchanged. The details and analysis of the Bank's outlook and the related issues for monetary policy will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report Update , to be released on 22 July 2004."
2004-09-08,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent. Data received since the July Monetary Policy Report Update indicate that Canada's economic growth in the first half of this year was somewhat stronger than the Bank had been expecting, largely as a result of more robust external demand for Canadian goods and services. The Bank judges that the economy is now operating close to its production capacity. Core inflation, which was 1.9 per cent in July, is consistent with this assessment. Total CPI inflation, at 2.3 per cent in July, has remained above expectations, primarily because oil prices have been persistently higher than the Bank had assumed. Looking forward, the Bank expects aggregate demand to grow at, or marginally above, the rate of growth of production capacity. With the economy operating close to its capacity, monetary stimulus needs to be reduced to avoid a buildup of inflationary pressures. In this context, the Bank decided to raise its target for the overnight rate. Uncertainties around the economic outlook continue to relate primarily to three factors the estimated size of the output gap, the future growth of Canadian exports and imports, and the overall effect on the Canadian economy of current and future movements in the world prices of oil and non energy commodities. In conducting monetary policy, the Bank will continue to pay attention to these factors as it assesses the evolving prospects for pressures on capacity and inflation."
2004-10-19,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 2 3/4 per cent. The Canadian economy is operating near its production capacity and continues to adjust to global economic developments. Recently, world oil prices have risen well above the Bank's earlier assumptions and the Canadian dollar has appreciated further. Looking ahead over the period to the end of 2006, the Bank's base case projection calls for aggregate demand for Canadian goods and services to expand, on average, at about the same rate as potential output. Given the effects of higher oil prices and the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Bank projects growth to be slightly less than 3 per cent in 2005, and slightly more than 3 per cent in 2006. With the economy expected to remain near its production capacity throughout this period, core inflation is projected to move back to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2005. Reflecting higher world oil prices, total CPI inflation is projected to move well above core inflation in the first half of 2005 and fall slightly below core inflation in 2006. Against this background, the Bank decided to raise its target for the overnight rate. Further reduction of monetary stimulus will be required over time to keep inflation on target, with the pace depending on the Bank's continuing assessment of the prospects for factors that affect pressures on capacity and, hence, inflation. The details of the Bank's outlook for output and inflation and an analysis of the significant risks and uncertainties associated with this outlook will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report , to be released on 21 October 2004."
2004-12-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 3/4 per cent. Information received since the October Monetary Policy Report MPR suggests that economic activity in Canada has been broadly in line with the Bank's expectations, with core inflation remaining below the 2 per cent inflation target. Although oil prices have declined, global economic growth prospects have moderated slightly. The U.S. dollar has depreciated further against major floating currencies, including the Canadian dollar. If exchange rates were to persist at current levels, and if all other economic and financial factors were to remain unchanged, there would be a dampening effect on aggregate demand for Canadian goods and services. In light of these considerations, the Bank decided to leave the target for the overnight rate unchanged. With the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent, a considerable amount of monetary stimulus remains in the Canadian economy. As well, the underlying trends in the global economy continue to point to solid economic growth. Accordingly, the Bank will be paying close attention to the prospects for factors that affect pressures on capacity and, hence, inflation. The main risks and uncertainties around the outlook for the Canadian economy remain those that the Bank identified and analyzed in the MPR . They relate to global imbalances, the realignment of currencies, commodity prices, the growing presence of emerging market economies such as China and India, and the related adjustments within the Canadian economy. The Bank will monitor these factors, with a view to keeping aggregate demand and supply in balance in order to achieve the inflation target."
2005-01-25,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 3/4 per cent. The Canadian economy continues to adjust to major global developments. Recent data suggest that Canada's economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2004 was marginally weaker than previously expected, owing partly to a somewhat more pronounced adjustment to the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar. Since the December fixed announcement date, the Canadian dollar has continued to trade in a higher range than was observed prior to the October Monetary Policy Report MPR . In large part reflecting the consequences for aggregate demand of this higher exchange rate, the Bank now expects the Canadian economy to operate a little further below its full production capacity in 2005 than was anticipated in the last MPR . Against this background, the Bank decided to leave the target for the overnight rate unchanged. The Monetary Policy Report Update , to be released on 27 January 2005, will provide details of the Bank's outlook for economic growth and inflation through 2006, including the attendant risks and uncertainties, and will consider the related issues for monetary policy."
2005-03-01,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 3/4 per cent. Since the release of the January Monetary Policy Report Update , the accumulated information on the Canadian and global economies has been broadly consistent with the Bank's expectations. Although the Canadian National Accounts indicated that output growth in the fourth quarter of 2004 was somewhat lower than anticipated in the Update , upward revisions to growth earlier in the year imply a level of economic activity at year end that is in line with the Bank's expectations. The outlook for the Canadian economy and inflation, the analysis of the factors at play, and the implications for the pace of reduction in monetary stimulus are essentially unchanged from those that the Bank presented in January's Update . Consistent with this assessment, the Bank decided to leave the target for the overnight rate unchanged."
2005-04-12,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 3/4 per cent. Data received since the Bank's last interest rate announcement on 1 March indicate that the Canadian and global economies have been evolving largely as expected. There is increasing evidence that the Canadian economy is adjusting to global developments. The Bank's outlook for the Canadian economy through to the end of 2006 is essentially unchanged from that in the January Monetary Policy Report Update , with growth this year and next expected to come primarily from strength in domestic demand. In these circumstances, the Bank decided to leave the target for the overnight rate unchanged. As the economy moves back to its production capacity in the second half of 2006, core inflation is projected to return to the 2 per cent target around the end of next year. In line with this outlook, a reduction of monetary stimulus will be required over time. There are both upside and downside risks to the outlook, which continue to relate largely to global developments, the associated relative price changes, and the adjustment of the Canadian economy. The details of the Bank's outlook for output and inflation and an analysis of the risks and uncertainties related to this outlook will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report , to be released on 14 April 2005."

2005-07-12,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 2 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 2 3/4 per cent. Global and Canadian economic developments since the 25 May interest rate announcement have been broadly consistent with the Bank's expectations. In Canada, further progress has been made in adjusting to global developments, and the economy is operating close to its production capacity. The Bank's outlook for output and inflation in Canada is little changed from the April Monetary Policy Report . The economy is thus projected to continue to operate near its production capacity this year and next, and inflation is expected to return to 2 per cent by the end of 2006. To support aggregate demand and facilitate the adjustment of the Canadian economy to global developments, the Bank has held the target for the overnight rate unchanged since October 2004. However, in line with the Bank's outlook, some reduction in the amount of monetary stimulus will be required in the near term to keep aggregate demand and supply in balance and inflation on target. The risks to the outlook through 2006 appear balanced, but over the medium term risks related to global imbalances are increasing. The Bank's outlook for output and inflation will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report Update , to be published on 14 July 2005."
2005-09-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 2 3/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 per cent. Information received since the July Monetary Policy Report Update MPRU indicates that the global and Canadian economies have generally evolved in line with the Bank's expectations, but world energy prices have moved above levels assumed at that time. Core and total CPI inflation in July were slightly below expectations, and the pace of growth and level of activity in the Canadian economy in the second quarter were somewhat higher than had been expected. With the economy operating close to full capacity, and consistent with the Bank's analysis in the MPRU , today's interest rate increase will help to promote a balance between aggregate demand and supply in the economy and keep inflation on target over the medium term. Hurricane Katrina has taken a tragic human toll in the U.S. gulf states. The Bank's preliminary assessment is that the hurricane's disruption to the U.S. economy is likely to translate into somewhat lower output growth in the United States over the balance of 2005 and somewhat higher growth in 2006. The overall impact on Canadian economic activity will probably be modest, although there will be a temporary spike in consumer prices, reflecting higher prices for gasoline and heating fuels. Despite developments associated with higher energy prices, risks to the Bank's outlook for the Canadian economy through 2006 still appear to be reasonably balanced. Over the medium term, however, there is increasing risk that the correction of global current account imbalances could involve a period of weakness in world aggregate demand. With the Canadian economy operating close to capacity and the stance of monetary policy still stimulative, the Bank will be monitoring developments closely and continuing to assess underlying trends in the economy and their implications for keeping inflation on target over the medium term."
2005-10-18,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/4 per cent. The global and Canadian economies have continued to grow at a solid pace. At the same time, there have been significant movements in energy prices and the Canadian dollar has traded in a higher range against the U.S. dollar and other major currencies. Overall, the Canadian economy now appears to be operating at its full production capacity. The Bank projects that the Canadian economy will continue to operate at about its production potential through 2007. CPI and core inflation are projected to be 2 per cent in the second half of 2006, although CPI inflation is expected to average near 3 per cent until then, boosted by high energy prices. Short term risks to this projection appear to be balanced. But as we look further out to 2007 and beyond, there are increasing risks that the unwinding of global economic imbalances could involve a period of weak global growth. In line with the Bank's outlook, and given that the Canadian economy now appears to be operating at capacity, some further reduction of monetary stimulus will be required to maintain a balance between aggregate supply and demand over the next four to six quarters, and to keep inflation on target. However, with the risks to the global outlook tilted to the downside as we look to 2007 and beyond, the Bank will monitor international developments particularly closely. More generally, the Bank will continue to assess the adjustments and underlying trends in the Canadian economy, as well as the balance of risks, as it conducts monetary policy to keep inflation on target over the medium term. The details of the Bank's outlook for output and inflation and an analysis of the risks and uncertainties related to this outlook will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report , to be released on 20 October 2005."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/2 per cent. Information received since the October Monetary Policy Report MPR indicates that the Canadian and global economies have been evolving largely in line with the Bank's expectations. In Canada, despite somewhat stronger than expected output growth in the third quarter, the Bank expects the level of economic activity at the end of 2005 to be about as projected in the MPR . Total CPI inflation, at 2.6 per cent in October, has come down more quickly than expected, primarily reflecting a rapid decline in gasoline prices. Core inflation, at 1.7 per cent in October, is in line with the Bank's projection. Overall, the Bank's outlook for the economy and inflation through 2006 and 2007 is broadly unchanged from October. The Bank continues to judge that the risks to the outlook are balanced over the short term, but are tilted to the downside through 2007 and beyond. In line with the outlook, some further reduction in monetary stimulus will be required to maintain a balance between aggregate supply and demand over the next four to six quarters and keep inflation on target.

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 3 3/4 per cent. Information received since the last interest rate announcement on 6 December indicates that the Canadian and global economies are evolving essentially in line with the Bank's expectations as set out in the October Monetary Policy Report MPR . The Canadian economy continues to adjust to global developments and to the associated changes in relative prices. CPI inflation, at 2.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2005, was lower than expected primarily because of lower gasoline prices. As anticipated, core inflation remained stable at 1.6 per cent. The level of economic activity at year end was close to expectations. The outlook for growth and inflation in Canada is similar to that in the October MPR . The Bank continues to judge that the Canadian economy is operating at its production capacity and will grow roughly in line with production potential through 2007. CPI and core inflation should return to the 2 per cent target by the first half of 2007. Risks to the Bank's projection remain balanced for 2006 and tilted to the downside through 2007 and beyond. Further details of the Bank's outlook for output and inflation will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Report Update , to be released on 26 January 2006. In line with the Bank's base case projection and current assessment of risks, some modest further increase in the policy interest rate would be required to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and inflation on target over the medium term."

The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 4 per cent. Information on the Canadian and global economies received since the January Monetary Policy Report Update has been broadly in line with the Bank's expectations, although the Canadian dollar has recently moved above the range that had been assumed in the Update . Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2005, as the Bank had projected, and both CPI and core inflation have also come in as expected. Overall, indications are that the Canadian economy is continuing to operate at its full production capacity. Recent data do not alter the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation, including its assessment of risks, as set out in the January Update . Consistent with this view, some modest further increase in the policy interest rate may be required to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and inflation on target over the medium term. The Bank will provide a full analysis of economic developments, trends, and risks in the next Monetary Policy Report , to be published on 27 April 2006."
2006-04-25,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/4 per cent. The global economy has been growing at a robust pace, exhibiting a little more momentum than had been anticipated. This global strength and the associated higher prices of many commodities, together with strong domestic demand in Canada, have produced solid growth in the Canadian economy at a pace consistent with the Bank's outlook in the January Monetary Policy Report Update . At the same time, global competition and the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar continue to pose challenges for a number of sectors of the economy. All factors considered, the Canadian economy is judged to be operating at, or just above, its production capacity. High energy prices have kept total CPI inflation in Canada somewhat above the Bank's 2 per cent target. Core inflation has remained below 2 per cent owing to persistent downward pressure from prices of imported consumer goods. Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to raise its target for the overnight rate. Looking forward, the Bank projects that the Canadian economy will grow by 3.1 per cent in 2006, 3.0 per cent in 2007, and 2.9 per cent in 2008. Total CPI inflation is projected to average close to 2 per cent in 2007 and 2008 excluding the effect of any changes in the GST . The Bank judges that the risks to its projection are roughly balanced, with a small tilt to the downside later in the projection period. In line with the Bank's outlook for the Canadian economy, some modest further increase in the policy interest rate may be required to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and inflation on target over the medium term. The Bank will closely monitor evolving developments in the Canadian economy in light of the cumulative increase in the policy interest rate since last September. A full analysis of economic developments, trends, and risks will be provided in the Monetary Policy Report , to be published on 27 April 2006."
2006-05-24,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/2 per cent. The strong momentum in the global and Canadian economies has continued, although there has recently been an increased degree of volatility in commodity markets, foreign exchange markets, and financial markets more generally. Recent Canadian data confirm that domestic demand remains solid, and that both CPI and core inflation are evolving largely in line with the Bank's expectations. With today's increase, the target for the overnight rate is now at a level that is expected to keep the Canadian economy on the base case path projected in the April Monetary Policy Report MPR and to return inflation to the 2 per cent target. The Bank will monitor global and domestic economic and financial developments, including adjustments in the Canadian economy, relative to the projection set out in the MPR . The Bank continues to assess the risks to this projection to be as presented in the MPR ."
2007-01-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 4 1/2 per cent. Global economic expansion has remained robust, although economic growth in the United States slowed during 2006. With weaker U.S. growth, output growth in Canada decelerated, likely averaging about 1.6 per cent in the second half of 2006. This was largely due to reduced U.S. demand for building materials and motor vehicles which has adversely affected Canada's exports and to the need for Canadian businesses to adjust inventories. Final domestic demand in Canada has continued to contribute strongly to growth. Inflation has evolved largely in line with the Bank's expectations in the October Monetary Policy Report MPR , with total CPI inflation slightly lower than projected and core inflation slightly higher. The Bank judges that at the end of 2006, the Canadian economy was operating at, or just above, its production capacity. There are signs that a significant amount of the adjustment in the U.S. housing and automotive sectors has already taken place and that the inventory correction in Canada is well advanced. Accordingly, the Bank projects that economic growth in Canada will pick up to about 2 1/2 per cent in the first half of 2007, and that the economy will continue to operate near its production capacity throughout 2007 and 2008. Total CPI inflation should average just above 1 per cent in the first half of 2007, returning to the 2 per cent inflation target in early 2008. Core inflation should return to 2 per cent in the first half of 2007 and remain there. The Bank continues to judge that the risks to the inflation projection are roughly balanced, but the main upside and downside risks outlined in the October MPR have diminished somewhat. In line with the Bank's outlook, the current level of the target for the overnight rate is judged, at this time, to be consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. An analysis of economic developments, trends, and risks will be outlined in the Monetary Policy Report Update , to be published on 18 January 2007."

Real gross domestic product in Canada increased in the fourth quarter of 2006 at a rate consistent with the Bank's projection in the MPRU , and both total CPI and core inflation have been largely as expected. At the end of 2006, the Canadian economy is judged to have been operating at, or just above, its production capacity. The Bank's outlook for output and inflation in Canada remains essentially unchanged from the MPRU . The Canadian economy is expected to continue to operate near its production capacity through 2007 and 2008. Total CPI inflation should average just above 1 per cent in the first half of 2007, returning to the 2 per cent target in 2008. Core inflation should remain near 2 per cent throughout this period. Despite recent volatility in global financial markets, the Bank continues to judge that the risks to its inflation projection are roughly balanced. The main downside risk continues to be that growth in the U.S. economy could be lower than expected. The main upside risk continues to be that household spending in Canada could be stronger than expected, largely because of borrowing against increased home equity. In line with the Bank's outlook, the current level of the target for the overnight rate is judged, at this time, to be consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. The Bank will present a full and updated analysis of economic and financial developments, trends, and risks in the Monetary Policy Report , to be published on 26 April 2007."
2007-04-24,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 4 1/2 per cent. Growth of the Canadian economy has been essentially in line with the Bank's expectations as set out in the January Monetary Policy Report Update. But inflation has been higher than expected. Pressures on capacity over the past year have been stronger than previously judged. Also, food and gasoline prices have recently risen more than expected. After considering the full range of indicators, the Bank now judges that the Canadian economy was operating just above its production capacity in the first quarter of this year. Robust domestic demand continues to support Canada's economic growth. Stronger than expected growth outside North America has led to rising demand for, and prices of, many commodities. However, the slowing U.S. economy has had a moderating effect on growth in Canada. Over the projection horizon, domestic demand is the main driver of growth in Canada. With the U.S. slowdown now expected to be somewhat more prolonged than previously projected, net exports should exert a slightly greater drag on growth in 2007. The Canadian economy is projected to grow by 2.2 per cent in 2007 and 2.7 per cent in both 2008 and 2009, returning to its production capacity in the second half of 2007 and remaining there through 2008 and 2009. Core inflation is projected to decline to 2 per cent by the end of 2007. Total CPI inflation is projected to rise above the 2 per cent inflation target in the second half of this year, before returning to the target by mid 2008. The upside risk to the Bank's inflation projection is that the recent strength of inflation could be more persistent than projected. The downside risk continues to come from the possibility of a more pronounced slowdown in the U.S. economy. The Bank continues to judge that the risks to its inflation projection are roughly balanced, although there is now a slight tilt to the upside. The current level of the target for the overnight rate is judged, at this time, to be consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. A full analysis of economic and financial developments, trends, and risks will be set out in the Bank's Monetary Policy Report , to be published on 26 April 2007."
2007-05-29,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 4 1/2 per cent. Information received since the April Monetary Policy Report MPR indicates that economic growth and inflation in Canada in the first part of this year have been stronger than the Bank was expecting. In April, both total CPI inflation, at 2.2 per cent, and core inflation, at 2.5 per cent, were above expectations. On the basis of available information, the Canadian economy is likely to have grown at an annual rate of about 3 1/2 per cent in the first quarter of this year a full percentage point higher than was estimated in the MPR . The Bank now judges that there is somewhat greater excess demand in the economy than was thought to be the case in April. U.S. economic activity has come in largely as expected and continuing robust growth outside North America has maintained the global demand for, and high prices of, many commodities produced in Canada. Against this overall backdrop, the Canadian dollar has risen appreciably above the range assumed in the Bank's April projection. On balance, the Bank judges that there is an increased risk that future inflation will persist above the 2 per cent inflation target and that some increase in the target for the overnight rate may be required in the near term to bring inflation back to the target. An updated analysis of the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation, including economic and financial developments, trends, and risks, will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report Update , to be published on 12 July 2007."
2007-07-10,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 4 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly increased, and the Bank Rate is now 4 3/4 per cent. Economic growth and inflation in Canada in the first half of this year have been stronger than expected in the April Monetary Policy Report MPR . Final domestic demand has remained the key driver of economic growth in Canada, bolstered by firm commodity prices. The Bank judges that the economy is now operating further above its production potential than was projected at the time of the April MPR . Both total CPI and core inflation have been higher than projected in April and are above the 2 per cent inflation target. Longer term interest rates have increased and the Canadian dollar has appreciated sharply, moving well above the trading range assumed in the last MPR . The Canadian economy is now projected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2007, somewhat stronger than was expected in April, and to grow somewhat more slowly in 2008 and 2009 than previously projected. In this new projection, higher interest rates across the yield curve and a higher assumed range for the Canadian dollar of 93 to 95.5 cents U.S. act to moderate growth in 2008 and 2009 to an average of about 2 1/2 per cent. This brings aggregate demand and supply in Canada back into balance in 2009. Inflation is projected to be slightly higher and more persistent than in the April MPR . However, as excess demand diminishes, total CPI and core inflation should decline to 2 per cent by early 2009. There are both upside and downside risks to the Bank's inflation projection. The main upside risk is that household demand in Canada could be stronger than expected. The main downside risks are related to the higher Canadian dollar and the ongoing adjustment in the U.S. housing sector. In the context of the Bank's new projection, these risks appear to be roughly balanced. In line with this outlook, the Bank is raising the target for the overnight rate to 4 1/2 per cent. Some modest further increase in the overnight rate may be required to bring inflation back to the target over the medium term. An analysis of the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation, including economic and financial developments and risks to the projection, will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report Update , to be published on 12 July 2007."
2007-09-05,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 4 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 4 3/4 per cent. Near term prospects for economic growth outside North America appear to be slightly stronger than anticipated in the July Monetary Policy Report Update MPRU , while near term economic prospects for the United States are weaker than expected. It now seems likely that the adjustment in the U.S. residential housing sector will be more pronounced and protracted, exacerbated by recent developments in financial markets. On balance, this implies weaker demand for Canadian exports than had been expected at the time of the July MPRU . In Canada, total and core CPI inflation in July, at 2.2 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively, continued to be above the inflation target but generally in line with the Bank's expectations. The Canadian dollar has also largely traded in the range assumed in the July MPRU . At the same time, the pace of economic growth in the first half of this year was above the Bank's expectations. It now appears that the Canadian economy is operating further above its production potential than was estimated in July. Domestic demand remains robust, buoyed by a continuing strong labour market and higher than expected increases in home sales and prices. However, recent developments in financial markets have led to some tightening of credit conditions for Canadian borrowers, which should temper growth in domestic demand. Against this background, the Bank judges that the current level of the target for the overnight rate is appropriate. However, there are significant upside and downside risks to the outlook for inflation. On the upside, there is a possibility that household demand in Canada could be stronger than anticipated, while on the downside the ongoing adjustment in the U.S. housing sector could be more severe and spill over to the U.S. economy more broadly. In addition, there is uncertainty about the extent and duration of the tightening of credit conditions in Canada and, hence, about the tempering effect this will have on growth in domestic demand. The Bank will continue to closely monitor evolving economic and financial developments. A full update of the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report , to be published on 18 October 2007."
2007-10-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 4 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 4 3/4 per cent. Against a backdrop of robust global economic expansion and strong commodity prices, information received since the July Monetary Policy Report Update MPRU indicates that the Canadian economy is now operating further above its production potential than had been previously expected. The core rate of inflation, which has been above 2 per cent for the past year, was 2.2 per cent in August. Total consumer price inflation fell temporarily in August to 1.7 per cent, having been above the 2 per cent inflation target since the spring. Since the July MPRU , the outlook for the U.S. economy has weakened because of greater than expected slowing in the housing sector. The Bank has revised down its projection for U.S. growth to 1.9 per cent in 2007 and 2.1 per cent in 2008. U.S. growth is expected to pick up to 3 per cent in 2009. The Canadian dollar traded in a range of 93 to 95.5 cents U.S. in July and August, but since then it has appreciated sharply to as high as 1.03 dollars U.S. In the Bank's new base case projection, the Canadian dollar is assumed to average 98 cents, the mid point of the range since the July MPRU . As well, there has been a tightening of credit conditions stemming from the financial market developments this summer. For Canada, the Bank assumes that the cost of credit for firms and households relative to the overnight rate will be 25 basis points higher over the projection period than it was prior to the summer developments. Despite these tighter credit conditions, momentum in domestic demand in Canada is expected to remain strong. The combined effect of a weaker U.S. outlook and a higher assumed level of the Canadian dollar implies, however, that net exports will exert a more significant drag on the economy in 2008 and 2009 than previously expected. As a result, the Canadian economy is projected to grow by 2.6 per cent in 2007, 2.3 per cent in 2008, and 2.5 per cent in 2009. This growth profile implies that aggregate supply and demand will move back into balance in early 2009. Both core and total CPI inflation are projected to return to 2 per cent in the second half of 2008. In line with this projection, the Bank judges, at this time, that the current level of the target for the overnight rate is consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. There are significant upside and downside risks to the Bank's inflation projection. On the upside, excess demand in the Canadian economy could persist longer than projected. This could come from two sources higher growth in household spending than projected and lower growth in productivity than assumed. On the downside, if the Canadian dollar exchange rate were to persist above the 98 cent U.S. level assumed over the projection horizon for reasons not associated with stronger than projected demand for Canadian products, Canadian output and inflation would be lower. In addition, the effect of the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar on demand and inflation could be stronger than expected and the effect of the weakness in the U.S. housing sector could be greater than anticipated. All factors considered, the Bank judges that the risks to its inflation projection are roughly balanced, with perhaps a slight tilt to the downside. A full update of the Bank's outlook for growth and inflation will be set out in the Monetary Policy Report , to be published on 18 October 2007."
2007-12-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/2 per cent. Since the October Monetary Policy Report MPR , there have been a number of economic and financial developments that have a bearing on the prospects for output and inflation in Canada. Consistent with the outlook in the MPR , the global economic expansion has remained robust and commodity prices have continued to be strong. The Canadian economy has been growing broadly in line with the Bank's expectations, reflecting in large part underlying strength in domestic demand. However, both total CPI inflation and core inflation in October, at 2.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively, were below the Bank's expectations, reflecting increased competitive pressures related to the level of the Canadian dollar. The Bank now expects inflation over the next several months to be lower than was projected in the MPR . In the context of exceptional volatility in global financial markets, the Canadian dollar spiked well above parity with the U.S. dollar in November, but it has recently traded closer to the 98 cent U.S. level assumed in the October MPR . Overall, the Canadian economy continues to operate above its production capacity. Given the strength of domestic demand and weak productivity growth, there continue to be upside risks to the Bank's inflation projection. However, other developments since October suggest that the downside risks to the Bank's inflation projection have increased. Global financial market difficulties related to the valuation of structured products and anticipated losses on U.S. sub prime mortgages have worsened since mid October, and are expected to persist for a longer period of time. In these circumstances, bank funding costs have increased globally and in Canada, and credit conditions have tightened further. There is an increased risk to the prospects for demand for Canadian exports as the outlook for the U.S. economy, and in particular the U.S. housing sector, has weakened. All these factors considered, the Bank judges that there has been a shift to the downside in the balance of risks around its October projection for inflation through 2009. In light of this shift, the Bank has decided to lower the target for the overnight rate. At its next interest rate decision in January, the Bank will assess all economic and financial developments and the balance of risks. A full projection for the economy and inflation will be published in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 24 January 2008."
2008-01-22,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 4 1/4 per cent. In the second half of 2007, the Canadian economy grew broadly in line with the Bank's expectations in the October Monetary Policy Report MPR . Despite some slowing in growth in the fourth quarter, the Canadian economy continues to operate above its production capacity. Both core and total CPI inflation have been lower than projected in the MPR , largely reflecting a price level adjustment related to increased competitive pressures in the retail sector stemming from the level of the Canadian dollar. Financial market conditions have deteriorated since October, leading to a tightening of credit conditions in industrial countries. Given this, and a deeper, more prolonged decline in the U.S. residential housing sector, the 2008 outlook for the U.S. economy is now significantly weaker than at the time of the October MPR . For Canada, the effects of the weaker U.S. economic outlook will lead to additional downward pressure on export growth. However, despite tighter credit conditions, domestic demand in Canada is projected to remain strong. This strength is supported by continued income growth associated with the increase in commodity prices since October, which has led to further gains in our terms of trade. Overall, the Bank now projects weaker growth in 2008 than was expected in October, with the economy moving into modest excess supply in the second quarter of this year. Somewhat stronger growth in 2009 brings the Canadian economy back into balance in early 2010. The inflation projection has also been revised down since October, especially for 2008, primarily reflecting the price level adjustment noted above and the recent one percentage point cut in the GST. Both core and total CPI inflation should fall below 1 1/2 per cent by the middle of this year before returning to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2009. On the whole, the Bank judges that the risks to this inflation projection are roughly balanced. In line with this outlook, the Bank has decided to lower the target for the overnight rate and further monetary stimulus is likely to be required in the near term to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and to return inflation to target over the medium term. The Bank's detailed projection for the economy and inflation, and risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 24 January 2008."
2008-03-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one half of one percentage point to 3 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 3/4 per cent. Information received since the January Monetary Policy Report Update MPRU indicates that economic growth in Canada through the four quarters of 2007 was broadly in line with expectations. Domestic demand has remained buoyant, as rising commodity prices and high employment have continued to support income growth. Canada's net exports weakened further in the fourth quarter, reflecting the slowing U.S. economy and the impact of the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar. Overall, the Canadian economy remained above its production capacity at year end. Core and total CPI inflation at 1.4 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively, in January have also been consistent with the Bank's expectations. At the same time, there are clear signs that the U.S. economy is likely to experience a deeper and more prolonged slowdown than had been projected in January. This stems from further weakening in the residential housing market, which is adversely affecting other sectors of the U.S. economy and contributing to further tightening in credit conditions. The deterioration in economic and financial conditions in the United States can be expected to have significant spillover effects on the global economy. These developments suggest that important downside risks to Canada's economic outlook that were identified in the MPRU are materializing and, in some respects, intensifying. The Bank now judges that the balance of risks around its January projection for inflation has clearly shifted to the downside, and, as a result, the Bank is lowering the target for the overnight rate. Further monetary stimulus is likely to be required in the near term to keep aggregate supply and demand in balance and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term. The Bank will publish a new projection for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy Report on 24 April 2008."
2008-04-22,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one half of a percentage point to 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3 1/4 per cent. Growth in the global economy has weakened, reflecting the effects of a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy and ongoing dislocations in global financial markets. Growth in the Canadian economy has also moderated as buoyant growth in domestic demand, supported by high employment levels and improved terms of trade, has been substantially offset by the fall in net exports. While both total and core CPI inflation were running at about 1.5 per cent at the end of the first quarter, the underlying trend of inflation is judged to be about 2 per cent, consistent with an economy that was operating just above its production capacity. The Bank is now projecting a deeper and more protracted slowdown in the U.S. economy. This has direct consequences for the Canadian economic outlook, with declining exports projected to exert a significant drag on growth in 2008. In addition, tightening credit conditions and softening sentiment are expected to moderate business investment and consumer spending. Nevertheless, domestic demand is projected to remain strong, supported by firm commodity prices, high employment levels, and the effect of cumulative easing in monetary policy. The Bank projects that the Canadian economy will grow by 1.4 per cent this year, 2.4 per cent in 2009, and 3.3 per cent in 2010. Consistent with this growth profile, the economy moves into excess supply in the second quarter of 2008, and spare capacity continues to increase through early next year. However, a gradual recovery in the U.S. economy, a return to more normal credit conditions, and accommodative monetary policy should generate above potential growth and bring the economy back into balance around mid 2010. The recent price level adjustments for automobiles and the effect of past changes in indirect taxes will keep measured inflation below target through 2008. The emergence of excess supply in the economy should keep downward pressure on inflation through 2009. Both core and total inflation are projected to move up to 2 per cent in 2010, as the economy moves back into balance. There are both upside and downside risks to the Bank's new projection for inflation these risks appear to be balanced. In line with this outlook, some further monetary stimulus will likely be required to achieve the inflation target over the medium term. Given the cumulative reduction in the target for the overnight rate of 150 basis points since December, the timing of any further monetary stimulus will depend on the evolution of the global economy and domestic demand, and their impact on inflation in Canada. A full analysis of economic and financial developments, trends, and risks will be set out in the Bank's Monetary Policy Report , to be published on 24 April 2008."
2008-06-10,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 1/4 per cent. Since the April Monetary Policy Report MPR , economic developments have been broadly in line with expectations. However, the balance of risks to the Bank's April projection for inflation in Canada has shifted slightly to the upside. Although the composition of U.S. growth has not been favourable for demand for Canadian goods and services, overall, global growth has been stronger and commodity prices have been sharply higher than expected. At the same time, many of the downside risks to inflation identified in the April MPR have eased, while the evolution of credit conditions has been in line with expectations. The risk remains that potential growth will be weaker than assumed. With the decline in first quarter GDP, the Canadian economy is judged to have moved into excess supply, which is expected to increase this year. Consistent with the April MPR , the Bank continues to project that economic growth will pick up this year and accelerate in 2009, owing in part to a firming of U.S. demand and accommodative monetary policy in Canada. If current levels of energy prices persist, total CPI inflation will rise above 3 per cent later this year. However, with the Canadian economy operating in excess supply, core inflation is expected to remain below 2 per cent through 2009. Both total and core inflation should converge on 2 per cent in 2010 as the economy returns to balance. Against this backdrop, the Bank now judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriately accommodative to bring aggregate demand and supply into balance and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. There continue to be important downside and upside risks to inflation in Canada, which the Bank will monitor closely."
2008-07-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 1/4 per cent. Three major developments are affecting the Canadian economy the protracted weakness in the U.S. economy ongoing turbulence in global financial markets and sharp increases in many commodity prices. The first two developments are evolving roughly in line with expectations in the April Monetary Policy Report . However, commodity prices are continuing to outstrip earlier expectations. This has led to further increases in Canada's terms of trade and real national income, and has altered the outlook for global and domestic inflation. Although Canadian economic growth in the first quarter was weaker than expected, final domestic demand continues to expand at a solid pace. The economy is judged to have moved into slight excess supply in the second quarter of this year excess supply is expected to increase over the balance of the year. High terms of trade, accommodative monetary policy, and a gradual recovery in the U.S. economy are expected to generate above potential growth starting early next year, bringing the economy back to full capacity around mid 2010. Canadian GDP is projected to grow by 1.0 per cent in 2008, 2.3 per cent in 2009, and 3.3 per cent in 2010. Total CPI inflation over the next year is expected to be much higher than projected at the time of the April Report . Assuming energy prices follow current futures prices over the projection period, total CPI inflation is projected to rise temporarily above 4 per cent, peaking in the first quarter of 2009. As energy prices stabilize and with medium term inflation expectations remaining well anchored, total inflation is then projected to converge to the core rate of inflation at the 2 per cent target in the second half of 2009. Core inflation is projected to remain well contained and broadly in line with earlier expectations, averaging close to 1.5 per cent through the third quarter of this year and then rising to 2 per cent in the second half of 2009. The three major developments affecting the Canadian economy pose significant upside and downside risks to the Bank's base case projection. Weighing the implications of these, the Bank views the risks to its base case projection for inflation as balanced. Against this backdrop, the Bank judges that the current level of the target for the overnight rate remains appropriate. The Bank will continue to monitor carefully the evolution of risks, together with economic and financial developments in the Canadian and global economies, and set monetary policy consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. The Bank's detailed projection for the economy and inflation, and its assessment of risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 17 July 2008."
2008-09-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is unchanged, and the Bank Rate remains at 3 1/4 per cent. The three global developments highlighted in the July Monetary Policy Report Update continue to have a major influence on the Canadian economy. Two of them the course of the U.S. economy and the ongoing turbulence in global financial markets have evolved broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. However, there is an increased risk of a more pronounced interplay between weakness in the U.S. economy and tightness in credit conditions that could affect the U.S. outlook for 2009. With respect to the third highlighted development, the sharp increases in commodity prices, the risk identified in July that these prices could be weaker than assumed has materialized. This has been largely due to the impact of slower global growth on the demand for energy. Given tight inventories, commodity prices can be expected to remain volatile. The reduction in commodity prices has been a significant factor in the decline of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The weaker global growth and the decline of the Canadian dollar will have opposing effects on the demand for Canadian goods and services. In Canada, domestic demand has slowed modestly but remains strong. It continues to be supported by financial conditions that remain significantly better than those in most other major economies and by income gains stemming from past improvements in the terms of trade. Overall, the level of economic activity is slightly lower than expected in July but still close to the economy's production capacity. Global inflationary pressures remain elevated, with potential implications for import prices and the dynamics of inflation in Canada. While total CPI inflation has moved above 3 per cent, core inflation has stayed at 1.5 per cent as expected. The temporary factors affecting both of these measures should dissipate over the coming quarters, and the Bank continues to expect that total and core inflation will converge on 2 per cent in the second half of 2009. However, the recent decline in both spot and futures prices for energy means that the spike in total CPI inflation expected between now and the first quarter of 2009 will be lower than projected in July. Given these developments, the Bank judges that the current level of the target for the overnight rate remains appropriately accommodative. The Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in the Canadian and global economies, together with the evolution of risks, and set monetary policy consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term."
2008-10-21,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of a percentage point to 2 1/4 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 2 1/2 per cent. Three major interrelated developments are having a profound impact on the Canadian economy. First, the intensification of the global financial crisis has led to severe strains in financial markets. The associated need for the global banking sector to continue to reduce leverage will restrain growth for some time. Second, the global economy appears to be heading into a mild recession, led by a U.S. economy already in recession. Third, there have been sharp declines in many commodity prices. The outlook for growth and inflation in Canada is now more uncertain than usual. Consistent with the G7 Plan of Action, major economies have announced extraordinary measures to stabilize their financial systems. These initiatives will be pivotal to resuming the flow of credit to support global economic growth. Canada's economy and strong financial system will benefit directly from these actions. The weaker outlook for global demand will increase the drag on the Canadian economy coming from exports. Lower commodity prices will also dampen the outlook, working through a deterioration in Canada's terms of trade to moderate domestic demand growth. The marked tightening in Canadian credit conditions in recent weeks will restrain business and housing investment. The Bank expects growth to be sluggish through the first quarter of next year, then to pick up over the rest of 2009 and to accelerate to above potential growth in 2010 supported by improving credit conditions, the lagged effects of monetary policy actions and stronger global growth. The recent sizeable depreciation of the Canadian dollar will also provide an important offset to the effects of weaker global demand and lower commodity prices. Overall, the Bank projects average annual growth in real GDP of 0.6 per cent in both 2008 and 2009, and 3.4 per cent in 2010. With excess supply projected to build throughout 2009 and lower assumed energy prices, inflationary pressures will ease significantly relative to the projection in the July Monetary Policy Report Update . Core inflation is now projected to remain below 2 per cent until the end of 2010. Total CPI inflation should peak during the third quarter of 2008, fall below 1 per cent in the middle of 2009, and then return to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2010. In the face of diminished inflationary pressures, the Bank of Canada lowered its policy interest rate by 50 basis points on 8 October, acting in concert with other major central banks. This extraordinary move, combined with today's announcement, brings the cumulative reduction in our target for the overnight rate to 75 basis points since the Bank's last fixed announcement date. These actions provide timely and significant support to the Canadian economy. The cumulative reduction in the Bank's policy rate since last December is now 225 basis points. In line with the new outlook, some further monetary stimulus will likely be required to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term. The evolution of the financial crisis, its impact on the global economy and the timing of the effects of the various extraordinary measures being taken to address it pose significant risks to the projection on both the upside and the downside. The Bank will publish the details of its new projection for the economy and inflation, including all the key risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy Report on 23 October 2008."
2008-12-09,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by three quarters of a percentage point to 1 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 1 3/4 per cent. The outlook for the world economy has deteriorated significantly and the global recession will be broader and deeper than previously anticipated. Global financial markets remain severely strained. Measures taken by major governments are beginning to encourage credit flows, although it will take some time before conditions in financial markets normalize. In addition, a series of recently announced monetary and fiscal policy actions will also support global economic growth. While Canada's economy evolved largely as expected during the summer and early autumn, it is now entering a recession as a result of the weakness in global economic activity. The recent declines in terms of trade, real income growth, and confidence are prompting more cautious behaviour by households and businesses. All of these factors imply a lower profile for core inflation than had been projected at the time of the last Monetary Policy Report in October. Several factors are helping to counterbalance the negative drag from the global economic and financial developments. The depreciation of the Canadian dollar will continue to provide an important offset to the effects of weaker global demand and lower commodity prices. As well, money markets and overall credit conditions in Canada are responding to significant and ongoing efforts to provide liquidity to the Canadian financial system. In light of the weakening outlook for growth and inflation, the Bank of Canada lowered its policy interest rate by a total of 75 basis points in October and by an additional 75 basis points today. These monetary policy actions provide timely and significant support to the Canadian economy. The Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in judging to what extent further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term."
2009-01-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one half of a percentage point to 1 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 1 1/4 per cent. The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated since the Bank's December interest rate announcement, with the intensifying financial crisis spilling over into real economic activity. Heightened uncertainty is undermining business and household confidence worldwide and further eroding domestic demand. Major advanced economies, including Canada's, are now in recession and emerging market economies are increasingly affected. Energy prices have fallen as a result of substantially weaker global demand. Stabilization of the global financial system is a precondition for economic recovery. To that end, governments and central banks are taking bold and concerted policy actions. There are signs that these extraordinary measures are starting to gain traction, although it will take some time for financial conditions to normalize. In addition, considerable monetary and fiscal policy stimulus is being provided worldwide. Canadian exports are down sharply, and domestic demand is shrinking as a result of declines in real income, household wealth, and consumer and business confidence. Canada's economy is projected to contract through mid 2009, with real GDP dropping by 1.2 per cent this year on an annual average basis. As policy actions begin to take hold in Canada and globally, and with support from the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar, real GDP is expected to rebound, growing by 3.8 per cent in 2010. A wider output gap through 2009 and modest decreases in housing prices should cause core CPI inflation to ease, bottoming at 1.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Total CPI inflation is expected to dip below zero for two quarters in 2009, reflecting year on year drops in energy prices. With inflation expectations well anchored, total and core inflation should return to the 2 per cent target in the first half of 2011 as the economy returns to potential. Against this background, the Bank today lowered its policy rate by 50 basis points, bringing the cumulative monetary policy easing to 350 basis points since December 2007. Guided by Canada's inflation targeting framework, the Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in judging to what extent further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve the 2 per cent target over the medium term. Low, stable, and predictable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to long term economic growth and financial stability."
2009-03-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one half of a percentage point to 1/2 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 3/4 per cent. The outlook for the global economy has continued to deteriorate since the Bank's January Monetary Policy Report Update , with weaker than expected activity in major economies. The nature of the U.S. recession, with very weak auto and housing sectors, is particularly challenging for Canada. Stabilization of the global financial system remains a precondition for the global and Canadian economic recoveries. The timely implementation of ambitious plans in some major countries to address toxic assets and recapitalize financial institutions will be critical in this regard. National accounts data for the fourth quarter of 2008 and other indicators of aggregate demand point to a sharper decline in Canadian economic activity and a larger output gap through the first half of 2009 than projected in January. Potential delays in stabilizing the global financial system, along with larger than anticipated confidence and wealth effects on domestic demand, could mean that the output gap will not begin to close until early 2010. These factors imply a slightly lower profile for core inflation than was projected in the January MPRU . The effects of the recent aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions in Canada and other major economies will begin to be felt in the second half of this year and will build through 2010. Once the global financial system stabilizes and global growth recovers, the underlying strength of the Canadian economy and financial sector should ensure a more rapid recovery in Canada than in most other industrialized economies. The Bank's decision to lower its policy rate by 50 basis points today brings the cumulative monetary policy easing to 400 basis points since December 2007. Consistent with returning total CPI inflation to 2 per cent, the target for the overnight rate can be expected to remain at this level or lower at least until there are clear signs that excess supply in the economy is being taken up. Given the low level of the target for the overnight rate, the Bank is refining the approach it would take to provide additional monetary stimulus, if required, through credit and quantitative easing. In its April Monetary Policy Report , the Bank will outline a framework for the possible use of such measures. The Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in judging to what extent further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve its 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term."
2009-04-21,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of a percentage point to 1/4 per cent, which the Bank judges to be the effective lower bound for that rate. The Bank Rate is correspondingly lowered to 1/2 per cent. The deposit rate the rate paid on deposits held by financial institutions at the Bank of Canada is left unchanged at 1/4 per cent and provides the floor for the overnight rate. Details of the Bank's operating framework at the effective lower bound can be found here . In an environment of continued high uncertainty, the global recession has intensified and become more synchronous since the Bank's January Monetary Policy Report Update , with weaker than expected activity in all major economies. Deteriorating credit conditions have spread quickly through trade, financial, and confidence channels. While more aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions are underway across the G20, measures to stabilize the global financial system have taken longer than expected to enact. As a result, the recession in Canada will be deeper than anticipated, with the economy projected to contract by 3.0 per cent in 2009. The Bank now expects the recovery to be delayed until the fourth quarter and to be more gradual. The economy is projected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2010 and 4.7 per cent in 2011, and to reach its production capacity in the third quarter of 2011. Given significant restructuring in a number of sectors, potential growth has been revised down. The recovery will be importantly supported by the Bank's accommodative monetary stance. The Bank expects core inflation to diminish through 2009, gradually returning to the 2 per cent target in the third quarter of 2011 as aggregate supply and demand return to balance. Total CPI inflation is expected to trough at 0.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2009 and return to target in the third quarter of 2011. While the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside. With monetary policy now operating at the effective lower bound for the overnight policy rate, it is appropriate to provide more explicit guidance than is usual regarding its future path so as to influence rates at longer maturities. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. The Bank will continue to provide such guidance in its scheduled interest rate announcements as long as the overnight rate is at the effective lower bound. To reinforce its conditional commitment to maintain the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent, the Bank will roll over a portion of its existing stock of one and three month term Purchase and Resale Agreements PRAs into six and twelve month terms at minimum and maximum bid rates that correspond to the target rate and the Bank Rate, respectively. These longer term PRAs will be issued according to the schedule released today. Today's decision to lower the policy rate by 25 basis points brings the cumulative monetary policy easing to 425 basis points since December 2007. It is the Bank's judgment that this cumulative easing, together with the conditional commitment, is the appropriate policy stance to move the economy back to full production capacity and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. The Bank retains considerable flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, consistent with the framework to be outlined in the Bank's Monetary Policy Report on 23 April."
2009-06-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Information received since the Bank's April Monetary Policy Report MPR is broadly consistent with the Bank's medium term outlook for output and inflation in Canada. The economy is undergoing major restructuring in a number of sectors. The already significant output gap will continue to widen through the third quarter, putting downward pressure on inflation. The Bank continues to expect that the global and Canadian recoveries will be more muted than usual. In recent weeks, financial conditions and commodity prices have improved significantly, and consumer and business confidence have recovered modestly. If the unprecedentedly rapid rise in the Canadian dollar which reflects a combination of higher commodity prices and generalized weakness in the U.S. currency proves persistent, it could fully offset these positive factors. The outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty. While the underlying macroeconomic risks are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection remain tilted slightly to the downside. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. The Bank retains considerable flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, consistent with the framework outlined in the April MPR."
2009-07-21,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. The global economy has suffered an intense, synchronous recession and considerable excess supply has opened up. There are now increasing signs that economic activity has begun to expand in many countries in response to monetary and fiscal policy stimulus and measures to stabilize the global financial system. However, the recovery is nascent. Effective and resolute policy implementation remains critical to sustained global growth. The dynamics of the recovery in Canada remain broadly consistent with the Bank's medium term outlook in its April Monetary Policy Report MPR . Stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, improved financial conditions, firmer commodity prices, and a rebound in business and consumer confidence are spurring domestic demand growth. However, the higher Canadian dollar, as well as ongoing restructuring in key industrial sectors, is significantly moderating the pace of overall growth. Some of the early strength in domestic demand represents a bringing forward of household expenditures, which modestly alters the profile of growth over the projection period relative to the April MPR. The Bank projects that the economy will contract by 2.3 per cent in 2009 and then grow by 3.0 per cent in 2010 and 3.5 per cent in 2011, reaching production capacity in the middle of 2011. Total CPI inflation declined to 0.3 per cent in June and should trough in the third quarter of this year before returning to the 2 per cent target in the second quarter of 2011 as aggregate supply and demand return to balance. Core inflation held up at 1.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2009. The Bank still expects core inflation to diminish in the second half of this year before gradually returning to 2 per cent in the second quarter of 2011. While the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. Consistent with this conditional commitment, the Bank will continue to conduct longer term Purchase and Resale Agreements based on existing terms and conditions and according to the accompanying schedule .

2009-09-10,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Global economic and financial developments have been broadly in line with the Bank's expectations. Following a deep, synchronous recession, recent indicators point to the start of recovery in major economies, supported by aggressive policy stimulus and the stabilization of global financial markets. In Canada, economic growth, the output gap, and inflation in the first half of 2009 have evolved largely as expected in the Bank's July Monetary Policy Report MPR . Stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, improved financial conditions, firmer commodity prices, and a rebound in business and consumer confidence are supporting domestic demand growth in Canada. Combined with recent information on inventory adjustments and automotive production, this suggests that GDP growth in the second half of 2009 could be stronger than the Bank projected in July. Total CPI inflation is still expected to trough in the current quarter before returning to the 2 per cent target in the second quarter of 2011 as aggregate supply and demand return to balance. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. While the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside.

In its conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, the Bank retains considerable flexibility, consistent with the framework outlined in the April MPR."
2009-10-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Recent indicators point to the start of a global recovery from a deep, synchronous recession. Global economic and financial developments have been somewhat more favourable than expected at the time of the July Monetary Policy Report MPR , although significant fragilities remain. A recovery in economic activity is also under way in Canada. This resumption of growth is supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus, increased household wealth, improving financial conditions, higher commodity prices, and stronger business and consumer confidence. However, heightened volatility and persistent strength in the Canadian dollar are working to slow growth and subdue inflation pressures. The current strength in the dollar is expected, over time, to more than fully offset the favourable developments since July. Given all of these factors, the Bank now projects that, relative to the July MPR, the composition of aggregate demand will shift further towards final domestic demand and away from net exports. Growth is expected to be slightly higher in the second half of this year than previously projected but to average slightly lower over the balance of the projection period. The Canadian economy is projected to grow by 3.0 per cent in 2010 and 3.3 per cent in 2011, after contracting by 2.4 per cent this year. This is a somewhat more modest recovery in Canada than the average of previous economic cycles. The Bank now expects that the output gap will be closed in the third quarter of 2011, one quarter later than it had projected in July. Correspondingly, inflation is also expected to return to the 2 per cent target in the third quarter of 2011, one quarter later than in July's projection. While the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside.

2009-12-08,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. While significant fragilities remain, global economic developments have been slightly more positive and the global outlook has improved modestly relative to the Bank's projection in its October Monetary Policy Report MPR . In Canada, as expected, the composition of aggregate demand is shifting towards final domestic demand and away from net exports. In the third quarter, the balance of these shifts resulted in weaker than projected GDP growth. Core inflation in recent months has been slightly higher than the Bank had projected, although total CPI inflation remains close to projections. The main drivers and the profile of the projected recovery in Canada remain consistent with the Bank's views in the October MPR. The Bank continues to expect economic growth to become more solidly entrenched over the projection period and inflation to return to the 2 per cent target in the second half of 2011. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. In its conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, the Bank retains considerable flexibility, consistent with the framework outlined in the April MPR. The risks to the outlook for inflation continue to be those outlined in the October MPR. On the upside, the main risks are stronger than projected global and domestic demand. On the downside, the main risks are a more protracted global recovery and persistent strength in the Canadian dollar that could act as a significant further drag on growth and put additional downward pressure on inflation. The Bank views all of these risks through the prism of achieving the 2 per cent inflation target. While the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside."
2010-01-19,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. The global economic recovery is under way, supported by continued improvements in financial conditions and stronger domestic demand growth in many emerging market economies. While the outlook for global growth through 2010 and 2011 is somewhat stronger than the Bank had projected in its October Monetary Policy Report , the recovery continues to depend on exceptional monetary and fiscal stimulus, as well as extraordinary measures taken to support financial systems. Economic growth in Canada resumed in the third quarter of 2009 and is expected to have picked up further in the fourth quarter. Total CPI inflation turned positive in the fourth quarter and the core rate of inflation has been slightly higher than expected in recent months. Nevertheless, considerable excess supply remains, and the Bank judges that the economy was operating about 3 per cent below its production capacity in the fourth quarter of 2009. Canada's economic recovery is expected to evolve largely as anticipated in the October MPR, with the economy returning to full capacity and inflation to the 2 per cent target in the third quarter of 2011. The Bank projects that the economy will grow by 2.9 per cent in 2010 and 3.5 per cent in 2011, after contracting by 2.5 per cent in 2009. The factors shaping the recovery are largely unchanged policy support, increased confidence, improving financial conditions, global growth, and higher terms of trade. At the same time, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar and the low absolute level of U.S. demand continue to act as significant drags on economic activity in Canada. On balance, these factors have shifted the composition of aggregate demand towards growth in domestic demand and away from net exports. The private sector should become the sole driver of domestic demand growth in 2011. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. Consistent with this conditional commitment, the Bank will continue to conduct term Purchase and Resale Agreements based on existing terms and conditions and according to the accompanying schedule . In its conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, the Bank retains considerable flexibility, consistent with the framework outlined in the April 2009 MPR. The risks to the outlook for inflation continue to be those outlined in the October MPR. On the upside, the main risks are stronger than projected global and domestic demand. On the downside, the main risks are a more protracted global recovery and persistent strength of the Canadian dollar that could act as a significant further drag on growth and put additional downward pressure on inflation.

2010-03-02,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. The ongoing global economic recovery is being driven largely by strong domestic demand growth in many emerging market economies and supported in advanced economies by exceptional monetary and fiscal stimulus, as well as extraordinary measures taken to support financial systems. The level of economic activity in Canada has been slightly higher than the Bank had projected in its January Monetary Policy Report MPR . The economy grew at an annual rate of 5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009, spurred by vigorous domestic spending and further recovery in exports. The underlying factors supporting Canada's recovery are largely unchanged policy stimulus, increased confidence, improved financial conditions, global growth, and higher terms of trade. At the same time, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar and the low absolute level of U.S. demand continue to act as significant drags on economic activity in Canada. Core inflation has been slightly firmer than projected, the result of both transitory factors and the higher level of economic activity. The outlook for inflation should continue to reflect the combined influences of stronger domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply. Conditional on the current outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. The risks to the outlook for inflation continue to be those outlined in the January MPR. On the upside, the main risks are stronger than projected global and domestic demand. On the downside, the main risks are a more protracted global recovery and persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. The Bank judges that the main macroeconomic risks to the inflation projection are roughly balanced."
2010-04-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Global economic growth has been somewhat stronger than projected, with momentum in emerging market economies increasing noticeably. Exceptional stimulus from monetary and fiscal policies continues to provide important support in many countries. The recovery in the major advanced economies is still expected to be relatively subdued, reflecting ongoing balance sheet adjustments and the gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus commencing later this year. Despite recent progress, considerable uncertainty remains about the durability of the global recovery. In Canada, the economic recovery is proceeding somewhat more rapidly than the Bank had projected in its January Monetary Policy Report MPR . The profile for growth is more front loaded than that presented in the January MPR. The Bank now projects that the economy will grow by 3.7 per cent in 2010 before slowing to 3.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.9 per cent in 2012. This profile reflects stronger near term global growth, very strong housing activity in Canada, and the Bank s assessment that policy stimulus resulted in more expenditures being brought forward in late 2009 and early 2010 than expected. At the same time, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar, Canada s poor relative productivity performance, and the low absolute level of U.S. demand will continue to act as significant drags on economic activity in Canada. The Bank expects the economy to return to full capacity in the second quarter of 2011. The outlook for inflation reflects the combined influences of stronger domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply. Core inflation, which has been somewhat firmer than projected in January, is expected to ease slightly in the second quarter of 2010 as the effect of temporary factors dissipates, and to remain near 2 per cent throughout the rest of the projection period. Total CPI inflation is expected to be slightly higher than 2 per cent over the coming year, before returning to the target in the second half of 2011. In response to the sharp, synchronous global recession, the Bank lowered its target rate rapidly over the course of 2008 and early 2009 to its lowest possible level. With its conditional commitment introduced in April 2009, the Bank also provided exceptional guidance on the likely path of its target rate. This unconventional policy provided considerable additional stimulus during a period of very weak economic conditions and major downside risks to the global and Canadian economies. With recent improvements in the economic outlook, the need for such extraordinary policy is now passing, and it is appropriate to begin to lessen the degree of monetary stimulus. The extent and timing will depend on the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and will be consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target. In accordance with the removal of the conditional commitment, there will be no additional term Purchase and Resale Agreements issued by the Bank."
2010-06-01,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly raised to 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is kept at 1/4 per cent, thus re establishing the normal operating band of 50 basis points for the overnight rate. The global economic recovery is proceeding but is increasingly uneven across countries, with strong momentum in emerging market economies, some consolidation of the recovery in the United States, Japan and other industrialized economies, and the possibility of renewed weakness in Europe. The required rebalancing of global growth has not yet materialized. In most advanced economies, the recovery remains heavily dependent on monetary and fiscal stimulus. In general, broad forces of household, bank, and sovereign deleveraging will add to the variability, and temper the pace, of global growth. Recent tensions in Europe are likely to result in higher borrowing costs and more rapid tightening of fiscal policy in some countries an important downside risk identified in the April Monetary Policy Report MPR . Thus far, the spillover into Canada from events in Europe has been limited to a modest fall in commodity prices and some tightening of financial conditions. Activity in Canada is unfolding largely as expected. The economy grew by a robust 6.1 per cent in the first quarter, led by housing and consumer spending. Employment growth has resumed. Going forward, household spending is expected to decelerate to a pace more consistent with income growth. The anticipated pickup in business investment will be important for a more balanced recovery. CPI inflation has been in line with the Bank s April projections. The outlook for inflation reflects the combined influences of strong domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply. In this context, the Bank has decided to raise the target for the overnight rate to 1/2 per cent and to re establish the normal functioning of the overnight market . This decision still leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in light of the significant excess supply in Canada, the strength of domestic spending, and the uneven global recovery. Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments."
2010-07-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent. The global economic recovery is proceeding but is not yet self sustaining. Greater emphasis on balance sheet repair by households, banks, and governments in a number of advanced economies is expected to temper the pace of global growth relative to the Bank's outlook in its April Monetary Policy Report MPR . While the policy response to the European sovereign debt crisis has reduced the risk of an adverse outcome and increased the prospect of sustainable long term growth, it is expected to slow the global recovery over the projection horizon. In the United States, private demand is picking up but remains uneven. Economic activity in Canada is unfolding largely as expected, led by government and consumer spending. Housing activity is declining markedly from high levels, consistent with the Bank's view that policy stimulus resulted in household expenditures being brought forward into late 2009 and early 2010. While employment growth has resumed, business investment appears to be held back by global uncertainties and has yet to recover from its sharp contraction during the recession. The Bank expects the economic recovery in Canada to be more gradual than it had projected in its April MPR, with growth of 3.5 per cent in 2010, 2.9 per cent in 2011, and 2.2 per cent in 2012. This revision reflects a slightly weaker profile for global economic growth and more modest consumption growth in Canada. The Bank anticipates that business investment and net exports will make a relatively larger contribution to growth. Inflation in Canada has been broadly in line with the Bank's April projection. While the Bank now expects the economy to return to full capacity at the end of 2011, two quarters later than had been anticipated in April, the underlying dynamics for inflation are little changed. Both total CPI and core inflation are expected to remain near 2 per cent throughout the projection period. The Bank will look through the transitory effects on inflation of changes to provincial indirect taxes. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to raise the target for the overnight rate to 3/4 per cent. This decision leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in light of the significant excess supply in Canada, the strength of domestic spending, and the uneven global recovery. Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments."
2010-09-08,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is raising its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economic recovery is proceeding but remains uneven, balancing strong activity in emerging market economies with weak growth in some advanced economies. In the United States, the recovery in private demand is being held back by high unemployment and recent indicators suggest a more muted recovery in the near term. Economic activity in Canada was slightly softer in the second quarter than the Bank had expected, although consumption and investment have evolved largely as anticipated. Going forward, consumption growth is expected to remain solid and business investment to rise strongly. Both are being supported by accommodative credit conditions, which have eased in recent weeks mainly owing to sharp declines in global bond yields. The Bank now expects the economic recovery in Canada to be slightly more gradual than it had projected in its July Monetary Policy Report MPR , largely reflecting a weaker profile for U.S. activity. Inflation in Canada has been broadly in line with the Bank's expectations and its dynamics are essentially unchanged. Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to increase its target for the overnight rate to 1 per cent. As a result of monetary policy measures taken since April, financial conditions in Canada have tightened modestly but remain exceptionally stimulative. This is consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada. Any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered in light of the unusual uncertainty surrounding the outlook."
2010-10-19,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economic recovery is entering a new phase. In advanced economies, temporary factors supporting growth in 2010 such as the inventory cycle and pent up demand have largely run their course and fiscal stimulus will shift to fiscal consolidation over the projection horizon. While the Bank expects that private demand in advanced economies will become sufficiently entrenched to sustain the recovery, the combination of difficult labour market dynamics and ongoing deleveraging in many advanced economies is expected to moderate the pace of growth relative to prior expectations. These factors will contribute to a weaker than projected recovery in the United States in particular. Growth in emerging market economies is expected to ease to a more sustainable pace as fiscal and monetary policies are tightened. Heightened tensions in currency markets and related risks associated with global imbalances could result in a more protracted and difficult global recovery. The economic outlook for Canada has changed. The Bank expects the economic recovery to be more gradual than it had projected in its July Monetary Policy Report , with growth of 3.0 per cent in 2010, 2.3 per cent in 2011, and 2.6 per cent in 2012. This more modest growth profile reflects a more gradual global recovery and a more subdued profile for household spending. With housing activity declining markedly as anticipated and household debt considerations becoming more important, the Bank expects household expenditures to decelerate to a pace closer to the rate of income growth over the projection horizon. Overall, the composition of demand in Canada is expected to shift away from government and household expenditures towards business investment and net exports. The strength of net exports will be sensitive to currency movements, the expected recovery in productivity growth, and the prospects for external demand. Inflation in Canada has been slightly below the Bank s July projection. The recent moderation in core inflation is consistent with the persistence of significant excess supply and a deceleration in the growth of unit labour costs. The Bank judges that the output gap is slightly larger and that the economy will return to full capacity by the end of 2012 rather than the beginning of that year, as had been anticipated in July. The inflation outlook has been revised down and both total CPI and core inflation are now expected to converge to 2 per cent by the end of 2012, as excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed and inflation expectations remain well anchored. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. This leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada. At this time of transition in the global recovery, with a weaker U.S. outlook, constraints beginning to moderate growth in emerging market economies, and domestic considerations that are expected to slow consumption and housing activity in Canada, any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered."
2010-12-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economic recovery is proceeding largely as expected, although risks have increased. As anticipated, private domestic demand in the United States is picking up slowly, while growth in emerging market economies has begun to ease to a more sustainable, but still robust, pace. In Europe, recent data have been consistent with a modest recovery. At the same time, there is an increased risk that sovereign debt concerns in several countries could trigger renewed strains in global financial markets. The recovery in Canada is proceeding at a moderate pace, although economic activity in the second half of 2010 appears slightly weaker than the Bank projected in its October Monetary Policy Report . In the third quarter, household spending was stronger than the Bank had anticipated and growth in business investment was robust. However, net exports were weaker than projected and continued to exert a significant drag on growth. This underlines a previously identified risk that a combination of disappointing productivity performance and persistent strength in the Canadian dollar could dampen the expected recovery of net exports. Inflation dynamics in Canada have been broadly in line with the Bank's expectations and the underlying pressures affecting prices remain largely unchanged. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. This leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada. Any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered."
2011-01-18,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economic recovery is proceeding at a somewhat faster pace than the Bank had anticipated, although risks remain elevated. Private domestic demand in the United States has picked up and will be reinforced by recently announced monetary and fiscal stimulus. European growth has also been slightly stronger than anticipated. Ongoing challenges associated with sovereign and bank balance sheets will limit the pace of the European recovery and are a significant source of uncertainty to the global outlook. In response to overheating, some emerging markets have begun to implement more restrictive policy measures. Their effectiveness will influence the path of commodity prices, which have increased significantly since the October Monetary Policy Report MPR , largely reflecting stronger global growth. The recovery in Canada is proceeding broadly as anticipated, with a period of more modest growth and the beginning of the expected rebalancing of demand. The contribution of government spending is expected to wind down this year, consistent with announced fiscal plans. Stretched household balance sheets are expected to restrain the pace of consumption growth and residential investment. In contrast, business investment will likely continue to rebound strongly, owing to stimulative financial conditions and competitive imperatives. Net exports are projected to contribute more to growth going forward, supported by stronger U.S. activity and global demand for commodities. However, the cumulative effects of the persistent strength in the Canadian dollar and Canada s poor relative productivity performance are restraining this recovery in net exports and contributing to a widening of Canada s current account deficit to a 20 year high. Overall, the Bank projects the economy will expand by 2.4 per cent in 2011 and 2.8 per cent in 2012 a slightly firmer profile than had been anticipated in the October MPR. With a little more excess supply in the near term, the Bank continues to expect that the economy will return to full capacity by the end of 2012. Underlying pressures affecting prices remain subdued, reflecting the considerable slack in the Canadian economy. Core inflation is projected to edge gradually up to 2 per cent by the end of 2012, as excess supply in the economy is slowly absorbed. Inflation expectations remain well anchored. Total CPI inflation is being boosted temporarily by the effects of provincial indirect taxes, but is expected to converge to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2012. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. This leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada. Any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered."
2011-03-01,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economic recovery is proceeding broadly in line with the Bank s projection in its January Monetary Policy Report MPR , although risks remain elevated. U.S. activity is solidifying and remains supported by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies. Ongoing challenges associated with sovereign and bank balance sheets will limit the pace of the European recovery and are a significant source of uncertainty to the global outlook. Robust demand from emerging market economies is driving the underlying strength in commodity prices, which could be further reinforced temporarily by supply shocks arising from recent geopolitical events. The recovery in Canada is proceeding slightly faster than expected, and there is more evidence of the anticipated rebalancing of demand. While consumption growth remains strong, there are signs that household spending is moving more in line with the growth in household incomes. Business investment continues to expand rapidly as companies take advantage of stimulative financial conditions and respond to competitive imperatives. There is early evidence of a recovery in net exports, supported by stronger U.S. activity and global demand for commodities. However, the export sector continues to face considerable challenges from the cumulative effects of the persistent strength in the Canadian dollar and Canada s poor relative productivity performance. While global inflationary pressures are rising, inflation in Canada has been consistent with the Bank's expectations. Underlying pressures affecting prices remain subdued, reflecting the considerable slack in the economy. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. This leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada.

2011-04-12,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. As anticipated in the January Monetary Policy Report MPR , the global economic recovery is becoming more firmly entrenched and is expected to continue at a steady pace. In the United States, growth is solidifying, although consolidation of household and ultimately government balance sheets will limit the pace of the expansion. European growth has strengthened, despite ongoing sovereign debt and banking challenges in the periphery. The disasters that struck Japan in March will severely affect its economic activity in the first half of this year and create short term disruptions to supply chains in advanced economies. Robust demand from emerging market economies is driving the underlying strength in commodity prices, which is being further reinforced by supply shocks arising from recent geopolitical events. These price increases, combined with persistent excess demand conditions in major emerging market economies, are contributing to the emergence of broader global inflationary pressures. Despite the significant challenges that weigh on the global outlook, global financial conditions remain very stimulative and investors have become noticeably less risk averse. Although recent economic activity in Canada has been stronger than the Bank had anticipated, the profile is largely consistent with the underlying dynamics outlined in the January MPR. Aggregate demand is rebalancing toward business investment and net exports, and away from government and household expenditures. As in January, the Bank expects business investment to continue to rise rapidly and the growth of consumer spending to evolve broadly in line with that of personal disposable income, although higher terms of trade and wealth are likely to support a slightly stronger profile for household expenditures than previously projected. In contrast, the improvement in net exports is expected to be further restrained by ongoing competitiveness challenges, which have been reinforced by the recent strength of the Canadian dollar. Overall, the Bank projects that the economy will expand by 2.9 per cent in 2011 and 2.6 per cent in 2012. Growth in 2013 is expected to equal that of potential output, at 2.1 per cent. The Bank expects that the economy will return to capacity in the middle of 2012, two quarters earlier than had been projected in the January MPR. While underlying inflation is subdued, a number of temporary factors will boost total CPI inflation to around 3 per cent in the second quarter of 2011 before total CPI inflation converges to the 2 per cent target by the middle of 2012. This short term volatility reflects the impact of recent sharp increases in energy prices and the ongoing boost from changes in provincial indirect taxes. Core inflation has fallen further in recent months, in part due to temporary factors. It is expected to rise gradually to 2 per cent by the middle of 2012 as excess supply in the economy is slowly absorbed, labour compensation growth stays modest, productivity recovers and inflation expectations remain well anchored. The persistent strength of the Canadian dollar could create even greater headwinds for the Canadian economy, putting additional downward pressure on inflation through weaker than expected net exports and larger declines in import prices. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. This leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of material excess supply in Canada. Any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered."
2011-05-31,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economic recovery is proceeding broadly as expected in the Bank s April Monetary Policy Report MPR . The U.S. economy continues to grow at a modest pace, limited by the consolidation of household balance sheets. Growth in Europe is maintaining momentum, although the risks related to peripheral economies have increased. The disasters that struck Japan in March are severely affecting its economic activity and causing temporary supply chain disruptions in advanced economies. Commodity prices have declined recently but are expected to remain at elevated levels, supported by tight global supply and very strong demand from emerging markets. These high prices, combined with persistent excess demand conditions in major emerging market economies, are contributing to broader global inflationary pressures. Despite the challenges that weigh on the global outlook, financial conditions remain very stimulative. In Canada, the economic expansion is proceeding largely as expected in the April MPR. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the first quarter, reflecting continued strong business investment, smaller contributions from household and government spending, and a modest drag from net exports. Although temporary supply chain disruptions are expected to restrain growth sharply in the current quarter, this is expected to be unwound in subsequent quarters. While underlying inflation is relatively subdued, the Bank expects that high energy prices and changes in provincial indirect taxes will keep total CPI inflation above 3 per cent in the short term. Total CPI inflation is expected to converge with core inflation at 2 per cent by the middle of 2012 as excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed, labour compensation growth stays modest, productivity recovers and inflation expectations remain well anchored. The possibility of greater momentum in household borrowing and spending in Canada represents an upside risk to inflation. On the other hand, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar could create even greater headwinds for the Canadian economy, putting additional downward pressure on inflation through weaker than expected net exports and larger declines in import prices. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. To the extent that the expansion continues and the current material excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed, some of the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will be eventually withdrawn, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target. Such reduction would need to be carefully considered."
2011-07-19,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economic expansion is proceeding broadly as projected in the Bank s April Monetary Policy Report MPR , with modest growth in major advanced economies and robust expansions in emerging economies. The U.S. economy has grown at a slower pace than expected and continues to be restrained by the consolidation of household balance sheets and slow growth in employment. While growth in core Europe has been stronger than expected, necessary fiscal austerity measures in a number of countries will restrain growth over the projection horizon. The Japanese economy has begun to recover from the disasters that struck in March, although the level of economic activity in that country will remain below previous expectations. In contrast, growth in emerging market economies, particularly China, remains very strong. As a consequence, commodity prices are expected to remain at elevated levels, following recent declines. These high prices, combined with persistent excess demand in major emerging market economies, are contributing to broader global inflationary pressures. Widespread concerns over sovereign debt have increased risk aversion and volatility in financial markets. In Canada, the economic expansion is proceeding largely as projected, although the expected rotation of demand is somewhat slower than had been anticipated. Household spending remains solid and business investment robust. Net exports remain weak, reflecting modest U.S. demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, particularly the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. Despite increased global risk aversion, financial conditions in Canada remain very stimulative and private credit growth is strong. Following an anticipated slowdown in growth during the second quarter due to temporary supply chain disruptions and the impact of higher energy prices on consumption, the Bank expects growth in Canada to re accelerate in the second half of 2011. Over the projection horizon, business investment is expected to remain strong, household spending to grow more in line with disposable income, and net exports to become more supportive of growth. Relative to the April projection, growth in household spending is now projected to be slightly firmer, reflecting higher household income, and net exports to be slightly weaker, reflecting more subdued U.S. activity. Overall, the Bank projects the economy will expand by 2.8 per cent in 2011, 2.6 per cent in 2012, and 2.1 per cent in 2013, returning to capacity in the middle of 2012. Total CPI inflation is expected to remain above 3 per cent in the near term, largely reflecting temporary factors such as significantly higher food and energy prices. Core inflation is slightly firmer than anticipated, owing to temporary factors and to more persistent strength in the prices of some services. Core inflation is now expected to remain around 2 per cent over the projection horizon. Total CPI inflation is expected to return to the 2 per cent target by the middle of 2012 as temporary factors unwind, excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed, labour compensation growth stays modest, productivity recovers, and inflation expectations remain well anchored. The Bank s projection assumes that authorities are able to contain the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis, although there are clear risks around this outcome. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. To the extent that the expansion continues and the current material excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed, some of the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will be withdrawn, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target. Such reduction would need to be carefully considered."
2011-09-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economic outlook has deteriorated in recent weeks as several downside risks to the projection in the Bank s July Monetary Policy Report MPR have been realized. The European sovereign debt crisis has intensified, a broad range of data has signalled slower global growth, and financial market volatility has increased sharply. Recent benchmark revisions show that the U.S. recession was deeper and its recovery has been shallower than previously reported. In combination with recent economic data, this implies that U.S. growth will be weaker than previously anticipated. The Bank expects that American household spending will be even more subdued in the face of high personal debt burdens, large declines in wealth and tough labour market conditions. Fiscal stimulus in the United States will also soon turn into material fiscal drag. Acute fiscal and financial strains in Europe have triggered a generalized retrenchment from risk taking and could prompt more severe dislocations in global financial markets. Resolution of these strains will require additional significant initiatives by European authorities. Growth in emerging market economies has been robust, although its rate and composition will be affected by weakness in major advanced economies. While commodity prices have declined owing to diminished global growth prospects, they remain relatively high. Largely due to temporary factors, Canadian economic growth stalled in the second quarter. The Bank continues to expect that growth will resume in the second half of this year, led by business investment and household expenditures, although lower wealth and incomes will likely moderate the pace of investment and consumption growth. The supply and price of credit to businesses and households remain very stimulative. However, financial conditions in Canada have tightened somewhat and could tighten further in the event that global financial conditions continue to deteriorate. Net exports are now expected to remain a major source of weakness, reflecting more modest global demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, in particular the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. Slower global economic momentum will dampen domestic resource utilization and inflationary pressures. The Bank expects total CPI inflation to continue to moderate as temporary factors, such as significantly higher food and energy prices, unwind. Core inflation is expected to remain well contained as labour compensation growth stays modest, productivity recovers, and inflation expectations remain well anchored. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. In light of slowing global economic momentum and heightened financial uncertainty, the need to withdraw monetary policy stimulus has diminished. The Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in the Canadian and global economies, together with the evolution of risks, and set monetary policy consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term."
2011-10-25,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economy has slowed markedly as several downside risks to the projection outlined in the Bank s July Monetary Policy Report MPR have been realized. Financial market volatility has increased and there has been a generalized retrenchment from risk taking across global markets. The combination of ongoing deleveraging by banks and households, increased fiscal austerity and declining business and consumer confidence is expected to restrain growth across the advanced economies. The Bank now expects that the euro area where these dynamics are most acute will experience a brief recession. The Bank s base case scenario assumes that the euro area crisis will be contained, although this assumption is clearly subject to downside risks. In the United States, diminished household confidence, tighter financial conditions and increased fiscal drag are expected to result in weak real GDP growth through the first half of 2012, before growth strengthens gradually thereafter. In Japan, reconstruction activity is projected to boost growth over 2012 13, although Japan s economy will be constrained by reduced global activity and the sharp appreciation of the yen. Growth in China and other emerging market economies is projected to moderate to a more sustainable pace in response to weaker external demand and the lagged effects of past policy tightening. These developments, combined with recent declines in commodity prices, are expected to dampen global inflationary pressures. The outlook for the Canadian economy has weakened since July, with the significantly less favourable external environment affecting Canada through financial, confidence and trade channels. Although Canadian growth rebounded in the third quarter with the unwinding of temporary factors, underlying economic momentum has slowed and is expected to remain modest through the middle of next year. Domestic demand is expected to remain the principal driver of growth over the projection horizon, though at a more subdued pace than previously anticipated. Household expenditures are now projected to grow relatively modestly as lower commodity prices and heightened volatility in financial markets weigh on the incomes, wealth and confidence of Canadian households. Business fixed investment is still expected to grow solidly in response to very stimulative financial conditions and heightened competitive pressures, although it will be dampened by the weaker and more uncertain global economic environment. Net exports are expected to remain a source of weakness, owing to sluggish foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. Overall, the Bank expects that growth in Canada will be slow through mid 2012 before picking up as the global economic environment improves, uncertainty dissipates and confidence increases. The Bank projects that the economy will expand by 2.1 per cent in 2011, 1.9 per cent in 2012, and 2.9 per cent in 2013. The weaker economic outlook implies greater and more persistent economic slack than previously anticipated, with the Canadian economy now expected to return to full capacity by the end of 2013. As a result, core inflation is expected to be slightly softer than previously expected, declining through 2012 before returning to 2 percent by the end of 2013. The projection for total CPI inflation has also been revised down, reflecting the recent reversal of earlier sharp increases in world energy prices as well as modestly weaker core inflation. Total CPI inflation is expected to trough around 1 per cent by the middle of 2012 before rising with core inflation to the two per cent target by the end of 2013, as excess supply in the economy is slowly absorbed. Several significant upside and downside risks are present in the inflation outlook for Canada. Overall, the Bank judges that these risks are roughly balanced over the projection horizon. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. With the target interest rate near historic lows and the financial system functioning well, there is considerable monetary policy stimulus in Canada. The Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in the Canadian and global economies, together with the evolution of risks, and set monetary policy consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term."
2011-12-06,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Uncertainty around the global economic outlook has increased in the weeks since the Bank released its October Monetary Policy Report MPR . Conditions in global financial markets have deteriorated as the sovereign debt crisis in Europe has deepened. Additional measures will be required to contain the European crisis. The recession in Europe is now expected to be more pronounced than the Bank had anticipated in October, as a result of increased deleveraging and tighter financial conditions, as well as necessary fiscal austerity and structural reforms. Recent economic data suggest that growth in the United States has been slightly more robust than anticipated, largely as a result of continued vigour in consumer spending and business investment. Nonetheless, household deleveraging, fiscal consolidation and negative spillover effects from the European crisis are all expected to weigh on U.S. growth. Growth in China and other emerging market economies continues to be strong, although there are signs that it is moderating to a more sustainable pace in response to weaker external demand and the lagged effects of past policy tightening. On balance, recent economic indicators in Canada suggest that growth in the second half of this year is slightly stronger than the Bank projected in October. Household expenditures have more momentum than had been expected and business investment remains solid. Going forward, the weaker external outlook is expected to dampen GDP growth in Canada through financial, confidence and trade channels. The economy also continues to face competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. Although total CPI inflation has been slightly higher than projected, the Bank continues to expect the inflation rate to decline as a result of reduced pressures from food and energy prices and ongoing excess supply in the economy. Core inflation has also been slightly firmer than projected and is expected to ease as the output gap persists well into 2013. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. With the target interest rate near historic lows and the financial system functioning well, there is considerable monetary policy stimulus in Canada. The Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in the Canadian and global economies, together with the evolution of risks, and set monetary policy consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term."
2012-01-17,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated and uncertainty has increased since the Bank released its October Monetary Policy Report MPR . The sovereign debt crisis in Europe has intensified, conditions in international financial markets have tightened and risk aversion has risen. The recession in Europe is now expected to be deeper and longer than the Bank had anticipated in October. The Bank continues to assume that European authorities will implement sufficient measures to contain the crisis, although this assumption is clearly subject to downside risks. In the United States, while the rebound in real GDP during the second half of 2011 was stronger than anticipated, the Bank expects the U.S. recovery will proceed at a more modest pace going forward, owing to ongoing household deleveraging, fiscal consolidation and the spillovers from Europe. Chinese growth is decelerating as expected towards a more sustainable pace. Commodity prices with the exception of oil are expected to be below the levels anticipated in the October MPR through 2013. The Bank s overall outlook for the Canadian economy is little changed from the October MPR. While the economy had more momentum than anticipated in the second half of 2011, the pace of growth going forward is expected to be more modest than previously envisaged, largely due to the external environment. Prolonged uncertainty about the global economic and financial environment is likely to dampen the rate of growth of business investment, albeit to a still solid pace. Net exports are expected to contribute little to growth, reflecting moderate foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. In contrast, very favourable financing conditions are expected to buttress consumer spending and housing activity. Household expenditures are expected to remain high relative to GDP and the ratio of household debt to income is projected to rise further. The Bank estimates that the economy grew by 2.4 per cent in 2011 and projects that it will grow by 2.0 per cent in 2012 and 2.8 per cent in 2013. While the economy appears to be operating with less slack than previously assumed, given the more modest growth profile, the economy is only anticipated to return to full capacity by the third quarter of 2013, one quarter earlier than was expected in October. The dynamics for inflation are similar to those anticipated in the October MPR, although the profile for inflation is marginally firmer. Both total and core inflation are expected to moderate in 2012 and subsequently rise, reaching 2 per cent by the third quarter of 2013 as excess supply is slowly absorbed, labour compensation grows modestly and inflation expectations remain well anchored. Several significant upside and downside risks are present in the inflation outlook for Canada. Overall, the Bank judges that these risks are roughly balanced over the projection horizon.

2012-03-08,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The heightened uncertainty around the global economic outlook has decreased in the weeks since the Bank released its January Monetary Policy Report MPR . With tentative signs of stabilisation in European bank funding and sovereign debt markets, conditions in global financial markets have improved and risk aversion has decreased. However, the global economy is still expected to grow below its trend rate as the deleveraging process in advanced economies proceeds. The U.S. expansion is proceeding at a modest pace, reinforced by recent improvements in the labour market. Growth in China is moderating to a still high rate as expected, in response to past policy tightening and weaker external demand. Commodity prices are higher than anticipated, supported by improved global economic conditions and a geo political risk premium on oil. If sustained, the latter could ultimately dampen the improvement in global economic momentum. Recent developments suggest that the outlook for the Canadian economy is marginally improved from the January MPR. Although the economy will likely grow faster than forecast in the first quarter due to temporary factors, underlying economic momentum remains around trend, balancing domestic strength and external weakness. Private demand is now expected to be slightly stronger than projected, owing to improved sentiment and highly supportive financial conditions. Canadian household spending is expected to remain high relative to GDP as households add to their debt burden, which remains the biggest domestic risk. Net exports have been supported by stronger than anticipated U.S. activity but are expected to contribute little to growth, reflecting still moderate foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. The profile for core and total CPI inflation is somewhat firmer than previously anticipated as a result of reduced economic slack and higher oil prices. After moderating in the second quarter, total inflation is expected, along with core inflation, to be around 2 per cent over the forecast horizon, reflecting the combination of modest growth of labour compensation, an economy operating around its potential over time, and well anchored inflation expectations. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. With the target interest rate near historic lows and the financial system functioning well, there is considerable monetary policy stimulus in Canada.

2012-04-17,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The profile for global economic growth has improved since the Bank released its January Monetary Policy Report MPR . Europe is expected to emerge slowly from recession in the second half of 2012, although the risks around this outlook remain high. The profile for U.S. growth is slightly stronger, reflecting the balance of somewhat improved labour markets, financial conditions and confidence on the one hand, and emerging fiscal consolidation and ongoing household deleveraging on the other. Economic activity in emerging market economies is expected to moderate to a still robust pace over the projection horizon, supported by an easing of macroeconomic policies. Improved global economic prospects, supply disruptions and geopolitical risks have kept commodity prices elevated. In particular, the international price of oil has risen further and is now considerably higher than that received by Canadian producers. If sustained, these oil price developments could dampen the improvement in economic momentum. Overall, economic momentum in Canada is slightly firmer than the Bank had expected in January. The external headwinds facing Canada have abated somewhat, with the U.S. recovery more resilient and financial conditions more supportive than previously anticipated. As a result, business and household confidence are improving faster than forecast in January. The Bank projects that private domestic demand will account for almost all of Canada s economic growth over the projection horizon. Household spending is expected to remain high relative to GDP as households add to their debt burden, which remains the biggest domestic risk. Business investment is projected to remain robust, reflecting solid balance sheets, very favourable credit conditions, continuing strong terms of trade and heightened competitive pressures. The contribution of government spending to growth is expected to be quite modest over the projection horizon, in line with recent federal and provincial budgets. The recovery in net exports is likely to remain weak in light of modest external demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. The Bank projects that the economy will grow by 2.4 per cent in both 2012 and 2013 before moderating to 2.2 per cent in 2014. The degree of economic slack has been somewhat smaller than the Bank had anticipated in January, and the economy is now expected to return to full capacity in the first half of 2013. As a result of this reduced slack and higher gasoline prices, the profile for inflation is expected to be somewhat firmer than anticipated in January. After moderating this quarter, total CPI inflation is expected, along with core inflation, to be around 2 per cent over the balance of the projection horizon as the economy reaches its production potential, the growth of labour compensation remains moderate, and inflation expectations stay well anchored. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. In light of the reduced slack in the economy and firmer underlying inflation, some modest withdrawal of the present considerable monetary policy stimulus may become appropriate, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term. The timing and degree of any such withdrawal will be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments."

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The outlook for global economic growth has weakened in recent weeks. Some of the risks around the European crisis are materializing and risks remain skewed to the downside. This is leading to a sharp deterioration in global financial conditions. While the U.S. economy continues to expand at a modest pace, economic activity in emerging market economies is slowing a bit faster and a bit more broadly than had been expected. More modest global momentum and heightened financial risk aversion have reduced commodity prices. Although economic growth in Canada was slightly slower than expected in the first quarter, underlying economic momentum appears largely consistent with expectations. However, the composition of growth is less balanced. In particular, housing activity has been stronger than expected, and households continue to add to their debt burden in an environment of modest income growth. Despite external events, business and household confidence has held up and domestic financial conditions remain very stimulative. The contribution of government spending to growth is expected to be quite modest over the projection horizon, in line with recent federal and provincial budgets. The recovery in net exports is likely to remain weak in light of modest external demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. The Canadian economy continues to operate with a small degree of excess capacity. Total CPI inflation is expected to fall below 2 per cent in the short term, as a result of lower gasoline prices, while core inflation is expected to remain around 2 per cent. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. To the extent that the economic expansion continues and the current excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed, some modest withdrawal of the present considerable monetary policy stimulus may become appropriate, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term. The timing and degree of any such withdrawal will be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments."
2012-07-17,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Global growth prospects have weakened since the Bank s April Monetary Policy Report MPR . While the economic expansion in the United States continues at a gradual but somewhat slower pace, developments in Europe point to a renewed contraction. In China and other emerging economies, the deceleration in growth has been greater than anticipated, reflecting past policy tightening and weaker external demand. This slowdown in global activity has led to a sizeable reduction in commodity prices, although they remain elevated. The combination of increasing global excess capacity over the projection horizon and reduced commodity prices is expected to moderate global inflationary pressures. Global financial conditions have also deteriorated since April, with periods of considerable volatility. The Bank s base case projection assumes that the European crisis will continue to be contained, although this assumption is subject to downside risks. While global headwinds are restraining Canadian economic activity, domestic factors are expected to support moderate growth in Canada. The Bank expects the economy to grow at a pace roughly in line with its production potential in the near term, before picking up through 2013. Consumption and business investment are expected to be the primary drivers of growth, reflecting very stimulative domestic financial conditions. However, their pace will be influenced by external headwinds, notably the effects of lower commodity prices on Canadian incomes and wealth, as well as by record high household debt. Housing activity is expected to slow from record levels. Government spending is not projected to contribute to growth in 2012 and to contribute only modestly thereafter, in line with plans to consolidate spending by federal and provincial governments. Canadian exports are projected to remain below their pre recession peak until the beginning of 2014, reflecting the dynamics of foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. The Bank projects that the economy will grow by 2.1 per cent in 2012, 2.3 per cent in 2013 and 2.5 per cent in 2014. The economy is expected to reach full capacity in the second half of 2013, thus operating with a small amount of slack for somewhat longer than previously anticipated. Core inflation is forecast to remain around 2 per cent over the projection horizon as the economy operates near its production potential, growth in labour compensation stays moderate and inflation expectations remain well anchored. Given the recent drop in gasoline prices and with futures prices suggesting persistently lower oil prices, the Bank expects total CPI inflation to remain noticeably below the 2 per cent target over the coming year before returning to target around mid 2013. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. To the extent that the economic expansion continues and the current excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed, some modest withdrawal of the present considerable monetary policy stimulus may become appropriate, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term.

2012-09-05,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Global growth prospects are unfolding largely as the Bank projected in its July Monetary Policy Report MPR , with a widespread slowing of activity across advanced and emerging economies. The economic expansion in the United States continues at a gradual pace. Europe is in recession and its crisis, while contained, remains acute. In China and other major emerging economies, growth is decelerating somewhat more quickly than expected from previously rapid rates, reflecting past policy tightening, weaker external demand, and the challenges of rebalancing towards domestic sources of growth. Notwithstanding the slower global momentum, prices for oil and other commodities produced by Canada have, on average, increased since July. In Canada, while global headwinds continue to restrain economic activity, underlying momentum remains at a pace roughly in line with the economy s production potential. Economic growth is expected to pick up through 2013, with consumption and business investment continuing to be its principal drivers, reflecting very stimulative financial conditions. Business investment remains solid. There are tentative signs of slowing in household spending, although the household debt burden continues to rise. Canadian exports are projected to remain below their pre recession peak until the beginning of 2014, reflecting the dynamics of foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. Core inflation has been softer than expected in recent months but, with the economy operating near its production potential, it is expected to return, along with total CPI inflation, to 2 per cent over the course of the next 12 months. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. To the extent that the economic expansion continues and the current excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed, some modest withdrawal of the present considerable monetary policy stimulus may become appropriate, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term.

2012-10-23,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economy has unfolded broadly as the Bank projected in its July Monetary Policy Report MPR . The economic expansion in the United States is progressing at a gradual pace. Europe is in recession and recent indicators point to a continued contraction. In China and other major emerging economies, growth has slowed somewhat more than expected, though there are signs of stabilization around current growth rates. Notwithstanding the slowdown in global economic activity, prices for oil and other commodities produced in Canada have, on average, increased in recent months. Global financial conditions have improved, supported by aggressive policy actions of major central banks, but sentiment remains fragile. In Canada, while global headwinds continue to restrain economic activity, domestic factors are supporting a moderate expansion. Following the recent period of below potential growth, the economy is expected to pick up and return to full capacity by the end of 2013. The Bank continues to project that the expansion will be driven mainly by growth in consumption and business investment, reflecting very stimulative domestic financial conditions. Housing activity is expected to decline from historically high levels, while the household debt burden is expected to rise further before stabilizing by the end of the projection horizon. Canadian exports are projected to pick up gradually but remain below their pre recession peak until the first half of 2014, reflecting weak foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges. These challenges include the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar, which is being influenced by safe haven flows and spillovers from global monetary policy. After taking into account revisions to the National Accounts, the Bank projects that the economy will grow by 2.2 per cent in 2012, 2.3 per cent in 2013 and 2.4 per cent in 2014. Core inflation has been lower than expected in recent months, reflecting somewhat softer prices across a wide range of goods and services. Core inflation is expected to increase gradually over coming quarters, reaching 2 per cent by the middle of 2013 as the economy gradually absorbs the current small degree of slack, the growth of labour compensation remains moderate and inflation expectations stay well anchored. Total CPI inflation has fallen noticeably below the 2 per cent target, as expected, and is projected to return to target by the end of 2013, somewhat later than previously anticipated. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. Over time, some modest withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus will likely be required, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target.

2012-12-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economy has unfolded broadly as the Bank projected in its October Monetary Policy Report MPR . The economic expansion in the United States is progressing at a gradual pace and is being held back by uncertainty related to the fiscal cliff. Europe remains in recession. Chinese growth appears to be stabilizing. Commodity prices have remained at elevated levels since the October MPR and global inflationary pressures are subdued in response to persistent excess capacity. Global financial conditions remain stimulative, though vulnerable to major shocks from the U.S. or Europe. In Canada, economic activity in the third quarter was weak, owing in part to transitory disruptions in the energy sector. Although underlying momentum appears slightly softer than previously anticipated, the pace of economic growth is expected to pick up through 2013. The expansion is expected to be driven mainly by growth in consumption and business investment, reflecting very stimulative domestic financial conditions. Housing activity is beginning to decline from historically high levels. While the household debt burden continues to rise, growth in household credit has slowed. It is too early, however, to determine whether the moderation in housing activity and credit growth will be sustained. Canadian exports are expected to pick up gradually but continue to be restrained by weak foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges. These challenges include the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar, which is being influenced by safe haven flows and spillovers from global monetary policy. Inflation has evolved broadly in line with the outlook in the October MPR. Both total and core inflation are expected to increase and return to 2 per cent over the course of the next 12 months as the economy gradually absorbs the current small degree of slack, the growth of labour compensation remains moderate and inflation expectations stay well anchored.

2013-01-23,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economic outlook is slightly weaker than the Bank had projected in its October Monetary Policy Report MPR . At the same time, global tail risks have diminished. The economic expansion in the United States is continuing at a gradual pace, restrained by ongoing public and private deleveraging, global weakness and uncertainty related to fiscal negotiations. Despite a marked improvement in peripheral sovereign debt markets, Europe remains in recession, with a somewhat more protracted downturn now expected than in October. Growth in China is improving, though economic activity has slowed further in some other major emerging economies. Supported by central bank actions and by positive policy developments in Europe, global financial conditions are more stimulative. Commodity prices have remained at historically elevated levels, though temporary disruptions and persistent transportation bottlenecks have led to a record discount on Canadian heavy crude. In Canada, the slowdown in the second half of 2012 was more pronounced than the Bank had anticipated, owing to weaker business investment and exports. Caution about high debt levels has begun to restrain household spending. The Bank expects economic growth to pick up through 2013. Business investment and exports are projected to rebound as foreign demand strengthens, uncertainty diminishes and the temporary factors that have weighed on resource sector activity are unwound. Nonetheless, exports should remain below their pre recession peak until the second half of 2014 owing to a lower track for foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. Consumption is expected to grow moderately and residential investment to decline further from historically high levels. The Bank expects trend growth in household credit to moderate further, with the debt to income ratio stabilizing near current levels. Relative to the October MPR, Canadian economic activity is expected to be more restrained. Following an estimated 1.9 per cent in 2012, the economy is expected to grow by 2.0 per cent in 2013 and 2.7 per cent in 2014. The Bank now expects the economy to reach full capacity in the second half of 2014, later than anticipated in the October MPR. Core inflation has softened by more than the Bank had expected, with more muted price pressures across a wide range of goods and services, consistent with the unexpected increase in excess capacity. Total CPI inflation has also been lower than anticipated, reflecting developments in core inflation and weaker than projected gasoline prices. Total CPI inflation is expected to remain around 1 per cent in the near term before rising gradually, along with core inflation, to the 2 per cent target in the second half of 2014 as the economy returns to full capacity and inflation expectations remain well anchored. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. While some modest withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus will likely be required over time, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target, the more muted inflation outlook and the beginnings of a more constructive evolution of imbalances in the household sector suggest that the timing of any such withdrawal is less imminent than previously anticipated."
2013-03-06,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economic outlook is broadly consistent with the Bank s projection in its January Monetary Policy Report MPR . Global financial conditions remain stimulative, despite recent volatility. In the United States, the economic expansion is continuing at a gradual pace and private sector demand is gaining momentum. Fiscal drag in the United States over the next two years remains consistent with the Bank s January projection, although it is likely to be more front loaded as a result of sequestration cuts. The recession in Europe continues. Growth in China has improved, while economic activity in some other major emerging economies is expected to benefit from policy stimulus. Commodity prices have remained at historically elevated levels, although persistent transportation bottlenecks are leading to continued discounts for Canadian heavy crude oil. Canada s economy grew by 0.6 per cent at annual rates in the fourth quarter of 2012, with solid growth across most domestic components of GDP offset by a sharp reduction in the pace of inventory investment. The Bank expects growth in Canada to pick up through 2013, supported by modest growth in household spending combined with a recovery in exports and solid business investment. With a more constructive evolution of imbalances in the household sector, residential investment is expected to decline further from historically high levels. The Bank expects trend growth in household credit to moderate further, with the debt to income ratio stabilizing near current levels. Despite the expected recovery in exports, they are likely to remain below their pre recession peak until the second half of 2014 owing to restrained foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. Total CPI inflation has been somewhat more subdued than projected in the January MPR as a result of weaker core inflation and lower mortgage interest costs, which were only partially offset by higher gasoline prices. Low core inflation reflects muted price pressures across a wide range of goods and services, consistent with material excess capacity in the economy. Core and total CPI inflation are expected to remain low in the near term before rising gradually to reach 2 per cent over the projection horizon as the economy returns to full capacity and inflation expectations remain well anchored. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. With continued slack in the Canadian economy, the muted outlook for inflation, and the more constructive evolution of imbalances in the household sector, the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will likely remain appropriate for a period of time, after which some modest withdrawal will likely be required, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target."
2013-04-17,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Global economic growth has evolved broadly as anticipated in the Bank s January Monetary Policy Report MPR . In the United States, the economic expansion is continuing at a modest pace, with gradually strengthening private demand partly offset by accelerated fiscal consolidation. Significant policy stimulus has been introduced in Japan. Europe, in contrast, remains in recession, with economic activity constrained by fiscal austerity, low confidence and tight credit conditions. After picking up to very strong rates in the second half of 2012, growth in China has eased. Commodity prices received by Canadian producers remain elevated by historical standards and, overall, they are little changed since the January MPR. The Bank expects global economic activity to grow modestly in 2013 before strengthening over the following two years. Following a weak second half of 2012, growth in Canada is projected to regain some momentum through 2013 as net exports pick up and business investment returns to more solid growth. Consumer spending is expected to grow at a moderate pace over the projection horizon, while residential investment declines further from historically high levels. Growth in total household credit has slowed and the Bank continues to expect that the household debt to income ratio will stabilize near current levels. Despite the projected recovery in exports, they are likely to remain below their pre recession peak until the second half of 2014 owing to restrained foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. On a quarterly basis, growth in Canada is expected to pick up to about 2.5 per cent in the second half of this year. Despite this expected pickup, with the weak growth in the second half of 2012, annual average growth is now projected to be 1.5 per cent in 2013. The economy is then projected to grow by 2.8 per cent in 2014 and 2.7 per cent in 2015, reaching full capacity in mid 2015 later than anticipated in the January MPR. Total CPI and core inflation have remained low in recent months, broadly in line with expectations in the January MPR. Muted core inflation reflects material excess supply in the economy, heightened competitive pressures in the retail sector, and some special factors such as slower increases in regulated prices and the pass through of previous declines in agricultural prices to consumer prices. Total CPI inflation has been restrained by low core inflation and declining mortgage interest costs, with some offset from higher gasoline prices. Both total and core inflation are expected to remain subdued in coming quarters before gradually rising to 2 per cent by mid 2015 as the economy returns to full capacity, the special factors that are weighing on core inflation subside, and inflation expectations remain well anchored. Reflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. With continued slack in the Canadian economy, the muted outlook for inflation, and the constructive evolution of imbalances in the household sector, the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will likely remain appropriate for a period of time, after which some modest withdrawal will likely be required, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target."

In the United States, the economic expansion is progressing at a modest pace, with continued strengthening in private demand partly offset by fiscal consolidation. Japan s economy is beginning to respond to significant policy stimulus. Europe, in contrast, remains in recession. Growth in China has continued to ease from very strong rates, weighing somewhat on global commodity prices. The Bank continues to expect global economic activity to grow modestly in 2013 before strengthening over the following two years. In Canada, recent economic indicators suggest that growth in the first quarter was stronger than the Bank projected in April. For the year as a whole, growth is expected to remain broadly in line with the Bank's MPR forecast. Over the projection horizon, consumer spending is expected to grow at a moderate pace, business investment to grow solidly, and residential investment to decline further from historically high levels. Growth in total household credit is slowing and the Bank continues to expect that the household debt to income ratio will stabilize near current levels. Exports are projected to continue to recover, but to be restrained by subdued foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. Core inflation is in line with the April MPR projection, while total CPI inflation has been slightly weaker.

2013-07-17,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Global economic growth remains modest, although the pace of economic activity varies significantly across the major economies. The U.S. economic expansion is proceeding at a moderate pace, with the continued strengthening in private demand being partly offset by the impact of fiscal consolidation. In Japan, fiscal and monetary policy stimulus is contributing to a rapid recovery in economic growth. In contrast, economic activity in the euro area remains weak. While stronger than in the advanced economies, real GDP growth in China and other emerging market economies has slowed, exerting downward pressure on global commodity prices and, as a consequence, the Bank has downgraded slightly its global growth forecast. The global economy is still expected to pick up in 2014 and 2015. In Canada, economic growth is expected to be choppy in the near term, owing to unusual temporary factors, although the overall outlook is little changed from the Bank s projection in its April Monetary Policy Report MPR . Annual GDP growth is projected to average 1.8 per cent in 2013 and 2.7 per cent in both 2014 and 2015, supported by very accommodative financial conditions. Despite ongoing competitiveness challenges, exports are projected to gather momentum, which should boost confidence and lead to increasingly solid growth in business investment. The economy will also be supported by continued growth in consumer spending, while further modest declines in residential investment are expected. Growth in real GDP is projected to be sufficient to absorb the current material excess capacity in the economy, closing the output gap around mid 2015, as projected in the April MPR. Inflation has been low in recent months and is expected to remain subdued in the near term. The weakness in core inflation reflects persistent material excess capacity, heightened competitive pressures on retailers, relatively subdued wage increases, and some temporary sector specific factors. Total CPI inflation has also been restrained by declining mortgage interest costs. As the economy gradually returns to full capacity and with inflation expectations well anchored, both core and total CPI inflation are expected to return to 2 per cent around mid 2015. Against this backdrop, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. As long as there is significant slack in the Canadian economy, the inflation outlook remains muted, and imbalances in the household sector continue to evolve constructively, the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will remain appropriate. Over time, as the normalization of these conditions unfolds, a gradual normalization of policy interest rates can also be expected, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target."
2013-09-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economy continues to expand broadly as expected, but its dynamic has moderated. In the United States, the process of normalization of long term interest rates has begun in the context of stronger private domestic demand. Recent data, however, point to slightly less momentum overall than anticipated. In Europe, there are early signs of a recovery, and Japan s situation remains promising. In a number of emerging market economies, financial volatility has increased, adding uncertainty to growth prospects, although China continues to grow at a solid pace. Commodity prices have been relatively stable, with geopolitical stresses putting some upward pressure on global oil prices. Uncertain global economic conditions appear to be delaying the anticipated rotation of demand in Canada towards exports and investment. While the housing sector has been slightly stronger than anticipated, household credit growth has continued to slow and mortgage interest rates are higher, pointing to a continued constructive evolution of household imbalances. Looking through the choppiness of the recent data, the level of Canada s GDP is largely consistent with the Bank s July forecast. The output gap is expected to begin to narrow in 2014. Inflation in Canada remains subdued. With inflation expectations well anchored, both core and total CPI inflation are expected to return slowly to 2 per cent as the output gap closes. Against this backdrop, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. As long as there is significant slack in the Canadian economy, the inflation outlook remains muted, and imbalances in the household sector continue to evolve constructively, the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will remain appropriate.

2013-10-23,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economy is expected to expand modestly in 2013, although its near term dynamic has changed and the composition of growth is now slightly less favourable for Canada. The U.S. economy is softer than expected but as fiscal headwinds dissipate and household deleveraging ends, growth should accelerate through 2014 and 2015. The nascent recovery in Europe, while modest, has surprised on the upside. China s economy is showing renewed momentum, while growth in a number of other emerging market economies has slowed as their financial conditions have tightened. Overall, the global economy is projected to grow by 2.8 per cent in 2013 and accelerate to 3.4 per cent in 2014 and 3.6 per cent in 2015. In Canada, uncertain global and domestic economic conditions are delaying the pick up in exports and business investment, leaving the level of economic activity lower than the Bank had been expecting. While household spending remains solid, slower growth of household credit and higher mortgage interest rates point to a gradual unwinding of household imbalances. The Bank expects that a better balance between domestic and foreign demand will be achieved over time and that growth will become more self sustaining. Real GDP growth is projected to increase from 1.6 per cent in 2013 to 2.3 per cent in 2014 and 2.6 per cent in 2015. The Bank expects that the economy will return gradually to full production capacity, around the end of 2015. Inflation in Canada has remained low in recent months, reflecting the significant slack in the economy, heightened competition in the retail sector, and other sector specific factors. With larger and more persistent excess supply in the economy, both total CPI and core inflation are expected to return more gradually to 2 per cent, around the end of 2015. Although the Bank considers the risks around its projected inflation path to be balanced, the fact that inflation has been persistently below target means that downside risks to inflation assume increasing importance. However, the Bank must also take into consideration the risk of exacerbating already elevated household imbalances. Weighing these considerations, the Bank judges that the substantial monetary policy stimulus currently in place remains appropriate and therefore has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent."
2013-12-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economy is expanding at a modest rate, as the Bank expected. Although growth in several emerging markets has continued to ease, growth in the United States during the third quarter of 2013 was stronger than forecast. Even if some of this pickup was due to temporary factors, the data are consistent with the Bank s view of gathering momentum in the U.S. economy. In Canada, underlying growth is broadly in line with the Bank s projections in its October and July Monetary Policy Reports . Real GDP growth in the third quarter, at 2.7 per cent, was stronger than the Bank was projecting, but its composition does not yet indicate a rebalancing towards exports and investment. The housing sector has been stronger than expected but is consistent with updated demographic data and a pulling forward of home purchases in light of favourable financing conditions. The Bank continues to expect a soft landing in the housing market. Non commodity exports continue to disappoint and the price of oil produced in Canada has eased further. Business investment spending is up from previous low levels, but is still recovering more slowly than anticipated. On balance, the Bank sees no reason to adjust its expectation of a gradual return to full production capacity around the end of 2015. Meanwhile, inflation has moved further below the Bank s 2 per cent target. Core inflation is being held down by significant excess supply and by the effects of heightened competition in the retail sector, which look to be more persistent than anticipated. In addition, total CPI inflation has been pushed down by lower gasoline prices. The risks associated with elevated household imbalances have not materially changed, while the downside risks to inflation appear to be greater. Overall, the balance of risks remains within the zone articulated in October. Weighing these considerations, the Bank judges that the substantial monetary policy stimulus currently in place remains appropriate and therefore has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent."
2014-01-22,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Inflation in Canada has moved further below the 2 per cent target, owing largely to significant excess supply in the economy and heightened competition in the retail sector. The path for inflation is now expected to be lower than previously anticipated for most of the projection period. The Bank expects inflation to return to the 2 per cent target in about two years, as the effects of retail competition dissipate and excess capacity is absorbed. Global growth is expected to strengthen over the next two years, rising from 2.9 per cent in 2013 to 3.4 per cent in 2014 and 3.7 per cent in 2015. The United States will lead this acceleration, aided by diminishing fiscal drag, accommodative monetary policy and stronger household balance sheets. The improving U.S. outlook is affecting global bond, equity, and currency markets. Growth in other regions is evolving largely as projected in the Bank s October Monetary Policy Report MPR . Global trade growth plunged after 2011, but is poised to recover as global demand strengthens. In Canada, growth improved in the second half of 2013. However, there have been few signs of the anticipated rebalancing towards exports and business investment. Stronger U.S. demand, as well as the recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar, should help to boost exports and, in turn, business confidence and investment. Meanwhile, recent data have been consistent with the Bank s expectation of a soft landing in the housing market and a stabilization of household indebtedness relative to income. Real GDP growth is projected to pick up from 1.8 per cent in 2013 to 2.5 per cent in both 2014 and 2015. This implies that the economy will return gradually to capacity over the next two years. Although the fundamental drivers of growth and future inflation appear to be strengthening, inflation is expected to remain well below target for some time, and therefore the downside risks to inflation have grown in importance. At the same time, risks associated with elevated household imbalances have not materially changed. Weighing these considerations, the Bank judges that the balance of risks remains within the zone articulated in October, and therefore has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The timing and direction of the next change to the policy rate will depend on how new information influences this balance of risks."

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Both total CPI and core inflation in Canada are still expected to follow roughly the path outlined in the January Monetary Policy Report , although recent readings were slightly higher than expected. Excess supply in the economy and competition in the retail sector will likely keep inflation well below the 2 per cent target this year. The global economy is evolving largely as anticipated, with growth expected to strengthen in 2014 and 2015. The United States is still expected to lead the acceleration in advanced economies, although recent data have been softer, largely owing to weather effects. Volatility in global financial markets has increased somewhat, reflecting buoyant market conditions in most advanced economies and increased risk differentiation among emerging markets. More recently, tensions in Ukraine have added to geopolitical uncertainty. In Canada, economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 was slightly stronger than the Bank anticipated, and upward revisions earlier in the year further raised the level of GDP. The Bank still expects underlying growth of around 2 1/2 per cent in 2014, with the current quarter likely to be softer. Exports have been a little stronger than previously thought but continue to underperform, and overall business investment has yet to pick up. Meanwhile, recent data support the Bank s expectation of a soft landing in the housing market and stabilizing debt to income ratios for households. On the whole, the fundamental drivers of growth and inflation in Canada continue to strengthen gradually, as anticipated. With inflation expected to be well below target for some time, the downside risks to inflation remain important. At the same time, the risks associated with elevated household imbalances have not materially changed. The Bank judges that the balance of risks remains within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate and therefore has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The timing and direction of the next change to the policy rate will depend on how new information influences this balance of risks."
2014-04-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Inflation in Canada remains low. Core inflation is expected to stay well below 2 per cent this year due to the effects of economic slack and heightened retail competition, and these effects will persist until early 2016. However, higher consumer energy prices and the lower Canadian dollar will exert temporary upward pressure on total CPI inflation, pushing it closer to the 2 per cent target in the coming quarters. We expect total CPI inflation will remain close to target throughout the projection, even as upward pressure from energy prices dissipates, because the impact of retail competition will gradually fade and excess capacity will be absorbed. The global economic expansion is expected to strengthen over the next three years as headwinds that have been restraining activity dissipate. The economic recovery in the United States appears to be on track, despite soft readings in the last few months largely due to unusual weather. Indeed, private demand could turn out to be stronger than anticipated. Europe s economy is growing modestly, but inflation remains too low and the nascent recovery could be undermined by risks emanating from the Russia Ukraine situation. In China and other emerging market economies growth is expected to be solid, although there are growing concerns about financial vulnerabilities. Overall, global growth is expected to pick up to 3.3 per cent in 2014 and increase further to 3.7 per cent in 2015 and 2016 largely unchanged from the January Monetary Policy Report MPR . The Bank continues to expect Canada s real GDP growth to average about 2 1/2 per cent in 2014 and 2015 before easing to around the 2 per cent growth rate of the economy s potential in 2016. Competitiveness challenges continue to weigh on Canadian exporters ability to benefit from stronger growth abroad. However, a range of export subsectors have been growing in line with fundamentals, which suggests that as the U.S. recovery gathers momentum and becomes more broadly based, many of our exports will benefit. The lower Canadian dollar should provide additional support. We continue to believe that rising global demand for Canadian goods and services, combined with the assumed high level of oil prices, will stimulate business investment in Canada and shift the economy to a more sustainable growth track. Recent developments are in line with the Bank s expectation of a soft landing in the housing market and stabilizing debt to income ratios for households. Still, household imbalances remain elevated and would pose a significant risk should economic conditions deteriorate. In sum, the Bank continues to see a gradual strengthening in the fundamental drivers of growth and inflation in Canada. This view hinges critically on the projected upturn in exports and investment. With underlying inflation expected to remain below target for some time, the downside risks to inflation remain important. At the same time, the risks associated with household imbalances remain elevated. The Bank judges that the balance of these risks remains within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate and therefore has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The timing and direction of the next change to the policy rate will depend on how new information influences the balance of risks."
2014-06-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Total CPI inflation has moved up to around the 2 per cent target, sooner than anticipated in the Bank s April Monetary Policy Report MPR , largely due to the temporary effects of higher energy prices and exchange rate pass through. Core inflation remains significantly below 2 per cent although it has drifted up slightly, partly owing to past exchange rate movements. Global economic growth in the first quarter of 2014 was weaker than anticipated in the MPR and recent developments give slightly greater weight to downside risks. The U.S. economy is rebounding after a pause in the first quarter, but there could be slightly less underlying momentum than previously expected. Globally, long term bond yields have continued their decline, reflecting in part growing market anticipation that interest rates will remain low over the long term. This, along with buoyant stock markets and tight credit spreads, indicates that financial conditions remain very stimulative. The Canadian economy grew at a modest rate in the first quarter, held back by severe weather and supply constraints. The ingredients for a pickup in exports remain in place, including the lower Canadian dollar and an anticipated strengthening of foreign demand. Improved corporate profits, especially in exchange rate sensitive sectors, should also support higher business investment in the coming quarters. There are continued signs of a soft landing in the housing market and a constructive evolution of household imbalances. We still expect excess supply to be absorbed gradually as the fundamental drivers of growth and inflation in Canada strengthen. Weighing recent higher inflation readings against slightly increased risks to economic growth leaves the downside risks to the inflation outlook as important as before. At the same time, the risks associated with household imbalances remain elevated. The Bank judges that the balance of risks remains within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate and therefore has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The timing and direction of the next change to the policy rate will depend on how new information influences the balance of risks."
2014-07-16,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Total CPI inflation has moved up to around the 2 per cent target in recent months, sooner than expected. Core inflation has also increased but remains below 2 per cent. Recent higher inflation is attributable to the temporary effects of higher energy prices, exchange rate pass through and other sector specific shocks, rather than to any change in domestic economic fundamentals. Over the next two years, inflation is projected to fluctuate around 2 per cent as these temporary effects ease and the downward pressure on inflation from economic slack and heightened retail competition gradually dissipates. The global economy is on a lower growth track than was foreseen at the time of the April Monetary Policy Report . Serial disappointment with economic performance during the past several years has mainly reflected the impact of private sector deleveraging, fiscal consolidation and, especially, the lingering effect of uncertainty on business investment and trade. Nevertheless, the Bank continues to project that global growth will gather momentum as these headwinds abate. Given the downgrade to the global outlook, economic activity in Canada is now projected to be a little weaker than previously forecast. However, the Bank still expects that the lower Canadian dollar and a projected strengthening in global demand will lead to a pickup in Canadian exports and business investment and, eventually, a more sustainable growth track. Meanwhile, household imbalances continue to evolve constructively and recent data are broadly consistent with a soft landing in Canada s housing market. Real GDP growth is projected to average around 2 1/4 per cent during 2014 2016. Consequently, the economy is expected to reach full capacity around mid 2016, a little later than anticipated in April. For the inflation target to be achieved on a sustained basis in 2016, the economy must reach and remain at full capacity. Closing the output gap over the time frame described above is reliant on continued stimulative monetary policy and hinges critically on stronger exports and business investment. Meanwhile, the risks associated with household imbalances, while evolving in a constructive way, are still elevated. Weighing these considerations within the Bank s risk management framework, the monetary policy stance remains appropriate and the target for the overnight rate remains at 1 per cent. The Bank is neutral with respect to the timing and direction of the next change to the policy rate, which will depend on how new information influences the outlook and assessment of risks."
2014-09-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Inflation is close to the 2 per cent target and is evolving as the Bank anticipated in its July Monetary Policy Report MPR . Recent data reinforce the Bank s view that the earlier pickup in inflation was attributable to the temporary effects of higher energy prices, exchange rate pass through, and other sector specific factors rather than to any change in domestic economic fundamentals. The global economy is performing largely as expected. The recovery in Europe appears to be faltering as the situation in Ukraine weighs on confidence. In the United States, a solid recovery seems to be back on track, with business investment now making a significant contribution to growth. Global financial conditions remain very stimulative and longer term bond yields have eased even further. In Canada, stronger growth in the second quarter has brought GDP to almost exactly the level the Bank had projected in July's MPR. Canadian exports surged in the second quarter after a weak winter, supported notably by stronger U.S. investment spending and the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar. While an increasing number of export sectors appear to be turning the corner toward recovery, this pickup will need to be sustained before it will translate into higher business investment and hiring. Meanwhile, activity in the housing market has been stronger than anticipated. The Bank still expects excess capacity in the economy to be absorbed during the next two years. Overall, the risks to the outlook for inflation remain roughly balanced, while the risks associated with household imbalances have not diminished. The balance of these risks is still within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate and therefore the target for the overnight rate remains at 1 per cent.

2014-10-22,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Inflation in Canada is close to the 2 per cent target. Core inflation rose more rapidly than was expected in the Bank s July Monetary Policy Report MPR , mainly reflecting unexpected sector specific factors. Total CPI inflation is evolving broadly as expected, as the pickup in core inflation was largely offset by lower energy prices. Underlying inflationary pressures are muted, given the persistent slack in the economy and the continued effects of competition in the retail sector. Although the outlook remains for stronger momentum in the global economy in 2015 and 2016, the profile is weaker than in July and growth prospects are diverging across regions. Persistent headwinds continue to buffet most economies and growth remains reliant on exceptional policy stimulus. Against a background of ongoing geopolitical uncertainties and lower confidence, energy prices have declined and there has been a significant correction in global financial markets, resulting in lower government bond yields. Despite weakness elsewhere, the U.S. economy is gaining traction, particularly in sectors that are beneficial to Canada s export prospects. The U.S. dollar has strengthened against other major currencies, including the Canadian dollar. In this context, Canada s exports have begun to respond. However, business investment remains weak. Meanwhile, the housing market and consumer spending are showing renewed vigour and auto sales have reached record highs, all fuelled by very low borrowing rates. The lower terms of trade will have a tempering effect on income. Canada s real GDP growth is projected to average close to 2 1/2 per cent over the next year before slowing gradually to 2 per cent by the end of 2016, roughly the estimated growth rate of potential output. As global headwinds recede, confidence in the sustainability of domestic and global demand should improve and business investment should pick up. Together with a moderation in the growth of household spending, this is expected to gradually return Canada s economy to a more balanced growth path. As the economy reaches its full capacity in the second half of 2016, both core and total CPI inflation are projected to be about 2 per cent on a sustained basis. Weighing all of these factors, the Bank judges that the risks to its inflation projection are roughly balanced. Meanwhile, the financial stability risks associated with household imbalances are edging higher. Overall, the balance of risks falls within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate and therefore the target for the overnight rate remains at 1 per cent."
2014-12-03,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Inflation has risen by more than expected. The increase in inflation over the past year is largely due to the temporary effects of a lower Canadian dollar and some sector specific factors, notably telecommunications and meat prices. Underlying inflation has edged up but remains below 2 per cent. The U.S. economy has clearly strengthened, particularly business investment, which has benefitted Canada s exports. Growth in the rest of the world, in contrast, continues to disappoint, leading authorities in some regions to deploy further policy stimulus. Oil prices have continued to fall, due to both supply and demand developments. In this context, global financial conditions have eased further. Canada's economy is showing signs of a broadening recovery. Stronger exports are beginning to be reflected in increased business investment and employment. This suggests that the hoped for sequence of rebuilding that will lead to balanced and self sustaining growth may finally have begun. However, the lower profile for oil and certain other commodity prices will weigh on the Canadian economy. The net effect of these recent developments, together with upward revisions to historical data, is that the output gap appears to be smaller than the Bank had projected in the October Monetary Policy Report MPR . However, the labour market continues to indicate significant slack in the economy. While inflation is at a higher starting point relative to the October MPR, weaker oil prices pose an important downside risk to the inflation profile. This is tempered by a stronger U.S. economy, Canadian dollar depreciation, and recent federal fiscal measures. Household imbalances, meanwhile, present a significant risk to financial stability. Overall, the balance of risks remains within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate and therefore the target for the overnight rate remains at 1 per cent."
2015-01-21,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent. This decision is in response to the recent sharp drop in oil prices, which will be negative for growth and underlying inflation in Canada. Inflation has remained close to the 2 per cent target in recent quarters. Core inflation has been temporarily boosted by sector specific factors and the pass through effects of the lower Canadian dollar, which are offsetting disinflationary pressures from slack in the economy and competition in the retail sector. Total CPI inflation is starting to reflect the fall in oil prices. Oil s sharp decline in the past six months is expected to boost global economic growth, especially in the United States, while widening the divergences among economies. Persistent headwinds from deleveraging and lingering uncertainty will influence the extent to which some oil importing countries benefit from lower prices. The Bank s base case projection assumes oil prices around US 60 per barrel. Prices are currently lower but our belief is that prices over the medium term are likely to be higher. The oil price shock is occurring against a backdrop of solid and more broadly based growth in Canada in recent quarters. Outside the energy sector, we are beginning to see the anticipated sequence of increased foreign demand, stronger exports, improved business confidence and investment, and employment growth. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the speed with which this sequence will evolve and how it will be affected by the drop in oil prices. Business investment in the energy producing sector will decline. Canada s weaker terms of trade will have an adverse impact on incomes and wealth, reducing domestic demand growth. Although there is considerable uncertainty around the outlook, the Bank is projecting real GDP growth will slow to about 1 1/2 per cent and the output gap to widen in the first half of 2015. The negative impact of lower oil prices will gradually be mitigated by a stronger U.S. economy, a weaker Canadian dollar, and the Bank s monetary policy response. The Bank expects Canada s economy to gradually strengthen in the second half of this year, with real GDP growth averaging 2.1 per cent in 2015 and 2.4 per cent in 2016. The economy is expected to return to full capacity around the end of 2016, a little later than was expected in October. Weaker oil prices will pull down the inflation profile. Total CPI inflation is projected to be temporarily below the inflation control range during 2015, moving back up to target the following year. Underlying inflation will ease in the near term but then return gradually to 2 per cent over the projection horizon. The oil price shock increases both downside risks to the inflation profile and financial stability risks. The Bank s policy action is intended to provide insurance against these risks, support the sectoral adjustment needed to strengthen investment and growth, and bring the Canadian economy back to full capacity and inflation to target within the projection horizon."
2015-03-04,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent. Total CPI inflation in Canada has fallen as expected, reflecting the significant drop in oil prices. Core inflation remains close to 2 per cent and continues to be temporarily boosted by the pass through effects of the lower Canadian dollar, as well as sector specific factors. The global economy is evolving broadly in line with projections in the Bank s January Monetary Policy Report MPR . The United States remains the main source of momentum in the global economy, while headwinds to growth linger in many regions. In this context, a growing number of central banks have taken actions to ease monetary conditions. Crude oil prices are close to the Bank s MPR assumptions. Canadian economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was consistent with the Bank s expectations. The oil price shock had a modest early impact on aggregate demand, and a larger effect on income. The Bank continues to expect that most of the negative impact from lower oil prices will appear in the first half of 2015, although it may be even more front loaded than projected in January. Nevertheless, data for 2014 as a whole suggest the anticipated rotation into stronger growth in non energy exports and investment is well underway. Financial conditions in Canada have eased materially since January, in response to the Bank s recent monetary policy action and to global financial developments. This easing is reflected across the yield curve and in a wide range of asset prices, including the Canadian dollar. These conditions will mitigate the negative effects of the oil price shock, further boosting growth through stronger non energy exports and investment. In light of these developments, the risks around the inflation profile are now more balanced and financial stability risks are evolving as expected in January. At present, we judge that the current degree of monetary policy stimulus is still appropriate and the target for the overnight rate remains at 3/4 per cent."
2015-04-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent. Total CPI inflation is at 1 per cent, reflecting the drop in consumer energy prices. Core inflation has remained close to 2 per cent in recent months, as the temporary effects of sector specific factors and pass through of the lower Canadian dollar have offset the disinflationary forces from slack in the economy. The Bank expects global growth to strengthen and average 3 1/2 per cent per year over 2015 17, in line with the projection in the January Monetary Policy Report MPR . This is in part because many central banks have eased monetary policies in recent months to counter persistent slack and low inflation, as well as the effect of lower commodity prices in some cases. At the same time, economies continue to adjust to lower oil prices, which have fluctuated at or below levels assumed in the January MPR. Strong growth in the United States is expected to resume in the second quarter of 2015 after a weak first quarter. The Canadian economy is estimated to have stalled in the first quarter of 2015. The Bank s assessment is that the impact of the oil price shock on growth will be more front loaded than predicted in January, but not larger. The ultimate size of this impact will need to be monitored closely. Underneath the effects of the oil price shock, the natural sequence of stronger non energy exports, increasing investment, and improving labour markets is progressing. This sequence will be bolstered by the considerable easing in financial conditions that has occurred and by improving U.S. demand. As the impact of the oil shock on growth starts to dissipate, this natural sequence is expected to re emerge as the dominant trend around mid year. Real GDP growth is projected to rebound in the second quarter and subsequently strengthen to average about 2 1/2 per cent on a quarterly basis until the middle of 2016. The Bank expects real GDP growth of 1.9 per cent in 2015, 2.5 per cent in 2016, and 2.0 per cent in 2017. The very weak first quarter has led to a widening of Canada s output gap and additional downward pressure on projected inflation. However, the anticipated recovery in growth means that the output gap will be back in line with its previous trajectory later this year. Consequently, the effects on core inflation of the lower dollar and the output gap will continue to offset each other. As the economy reaches and remains at full capacity around the end of 2016, both total and core inflation are projected to be close to 2 per cent on a sustained basis. Risks to the outlook for inflation are now roughly balanced and risks to financial stability appear to be evolving as expected. The Bank judges that the current degree of monetary policy stimulus remains appropriate and therefore is maintaining the target for the overnight rate at 3/4 per cent."
2015-05-27,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent. Inflation in Canada continues to track the path outlined in the Bank s April Monetary Policy Report MPR . Total CPI inflation is near the bottom of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation control range, largely due to the transitory effects of sharply lower energy prices. Core inflation remains above 2 per cent, boosted by the pass through effects of past depreciation of the Canadian dollar, as well as certain sector specific factors. Seeing through the various temporary factors, the Bank estimates that the underlying trend of inflation is 1.6 to 1.8 per cent, consistent with persistent slack in the economy. The outlook for the Canadian economy also remains largely in line with the April MPR. While a weak first quarter in the United States has raised questions about that economy s underlying strength, the Bank expects a return to solid growth in the second quarter. This will help advance the rotation of demand in Canada toward more exports and business investment. Recent indicators suggest consumption in Canada is holding up relatively well, given the impact of lower oil prices on gross domestic income. Despite the recent back up in global bond yields, financial conditions for Canadian households and firms remain highly stimulative. The Canadian dollar has strengthened in recent weeks in the context of higher oil prices and a softer U.S. dollar. If these developments are sustained, their net effect will need to be assessed as more data become available in the months ahead. Although a number of complex adjustments are under way, the Bank s assessment of risks to the inflation profile has not materially changed. Risks to financial stability remain elevated, but appear to be evolving as expected. Weighing all of these risks, the Bank judges that the current degree of monetary policy stimulus remains appropriate and therefore the target for the overnight rate remains at 3/4 per cent."
2015-07-15,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one quarter of one percentage point to 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Total CPI inflation in Canada has been around 1 per cent in recent months, reflecting year over year price declines for consumer energy products. Core inflation has been close to 2 per cent, with disinflationary pressures from economic slack being offset by transitory effects of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar and some sector specific factors. Setting aside these transitory effects, the Bank judges that the underlying trend in inflation is about 1.5 to 1.7 per cent. Global growth faltered in early 2015, principally in the United States and China. Recent indicators suggest a rebound in the U.S. economy in the second half of this year, and growth is expected to be solid through the projection. In contrast, China is slowing amid an ongoing process of rebalancing to a more sustainable growth path. This has pulled down prices of certain commodities that are important to Canada s exports. Financial conditions in major economies remain very accommodative and continue to provide much needed support to economic activity. Global growth is expected to strengthen over the second half of 2015, averaging about 3 per cent for the year, and accelerate to around 3 1/2 per cent in 2016 and 2017. The Bank s estimate of growth in Canada in 2015 has been marked down considerably from its April projection. The downward revision reflects further downgrades of business investment plans in the energy sector, as well as weaker than expected exports of non energy commodities and non commodities. Real GDP is now projected to have contracted modestly in the first half of the year, resulting in higher excess capacity and additional downward pressure on inflation. The Bank expects growth to resume in the third quarter and begin to exceed potential again in the fourth quarter, led by the non resource sectors of Canada s economy. Outside the energy producing regions, consumer confidence remains high and labour markets continue to improve. This will support consumption, which will also receive a fiscal boost. Recent evidence suggests a pickup in activity and rising capacity pressures among manufacturers, particularly those exporters that are most sensitive to movements in the Canadian dollar. Financial conditions for households and businesses remain very stimulative. The Bank now projects Canada s real GDP will grow by just over 1 per cent in 2015 and about 2 1/2 per cent in 2016 and 2017. With this revised growth profile, the output gap is significantly larger than was expected in April, and closes somewhat later. The Bank anticipates that the economy will return to full capacity and inflation to 2 per cent on a sustained basis in the first half of 2017. The lower outlook for Canadian growth has increased the downside risks to inflation. While vulnerabilities associated with household imbalances remain elevated and could edge higher, Canada s economy is undergoing a significant and complex adjustment. Additional monetary stimulus is required at this time to help return the economy to full capacity and inflation sustainably to target."

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 nbsp per nbsp cent. Inflation has evolved in line with the outlook in the Bank s July Monetary Policy Report MPR . Total CPI inflation remains near the bottom of the target range, reflecting year over year price declines for consumer energy products. Core inflation has been close to 2 per cent, with disinflationary pressures from economic slack being offset by transitory effects of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar and some sector specific factors. The dynamics of GDP growth in Canada outlined in July s MPR also remain intact. The stimulative effects of previous monetary policy actions are working their way through the Canadian economy. Canada s resource sector continues to adjust to lower prices for oil and other commodities, with some spillover to the rest of the economy. These adjustments are complex and are expected to take considerable time. Economic activity continues to be underpinned by solid household spending and a firm recovery in the United States, with particular strength in the sectors of the U.S. economy that are important for Canadian exports. Increasing uncertainty about growth prospects for China and other emerging market economies, in contrast, is raising questions about the pace of the global recovery. This has contributed to heightened financial market volatility and lower commodity prices. Movements in the Canadian dollar are helping to absorb some of the impact of lower commodity prices and are facilitating the adjustments taking place in Canada s economy. While the overall export picture is still uncertain, the latest data confirm that exchange rate sensitive exports are regaining momentum. Meanwhile, risks to financial stability are evolving as expected. Taking all of these developments into consideration, the Bank judges that the risks to the outlook for inflation remain within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Therefore, the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."

The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Inflation has evolved in line with the outlook in the Bank s July Monetary Policy Report MPR . Total CPI inflation remains near the bottom of the Bank s target range, owing to declines in consumer energy prices. Core inflation is close to 2 per cent as the transitory effects of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar are roughly offsetting disinflationary pressures from economic slack, which has increased this year. The Bank judges that the underlying trend in inflation continues to be about 1.5 to 1.7 per cent. Global economic growth has been a little weaker than expected this year, but the dynamics pointing to a pickup in 2016 and 2017 remain largely intact. Uncertainty about China s transition to a slower growth path has contributed to further downward pressure on prices for oil and other commodities. These factors are weighing on growth in many emerging markets and some other economies. Looking ahead to 2016 and 2017, the positive effects of cheaper energy and broadly accommodative financial conditions should become increasingly evident. In the United States, the economy is expected to continue growing at a solid pace with particular strength in private domestic demand, which is important for Canadian exports. Canada s economy has rebounded, as projected in July. In non resource sectors, the looked for signs of strength are more evident, supported by the stimulative effects of previous monetary policy actions and past depreciation of the Canadian dollar. Household spending continues to underpin economic activity and is expected to grow at a moderate pace over the projection period. However, lower prices for oil and other commodities since the summer have further lowered Canada s terms of trade and are dampening business investment and exports in the resource sector. This has led to a modest downward revision to the Bank s growth forecast for 2016 and 2017. The Bank projects real GDP will grow by just over 1 per cent in 2015 before firming to about 2 per cent in 2016 and 2 1/2 per cent in 2017. The complex economic adjustments to the decline in Canada s terms of trade will continue to play out over the projection horizon. The weaker profile for business investment suggests that, in the near term, growth in potential output is more likely to be in the lower part of the Bank s range of estimates. Given this judgment about potential output, the Canadian economy can be expected to return to full capacity, and inflation sustainably to target, around mid 2017. The Bank judges that the risks around the inflation profile are roughly balanced. Meanwhile, as financial vulnerabilities in the household sector continue to edge higher, risks to financial stability are evolving as expected. Taking all of these developments into consideration, the Bank judges that the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. Therefore, the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."
2015-12-02,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Global economic growth is evolving essentially as the Bank had anticipated in its October Monetary Policy Report MPR . The US economy continues to grow at a solid pace, although private domestic demand has proven slightly less robust than expected. Meanwhile, commodity prices have declined further. The ongoing terms of trade adjustments and shifting growth prospects across different regions are contributing to exchange rate movements. In this context, policy divergence is expected to remain a prominent theme. In Canada, the dynamics of growth have been broadly in line with the Bank s MPR outlook. The economy continues to undergo a complex and lengthy adjustment to the decline in Canada s terms of trade. This adjustment is being aided by the ongoing US recovery, a lower Canadian dollar and the Bank s monetary policy easing this year. The resource sector is still contending with lower prices for commodities. In non resource sectors, exports are picking up, particularly in exchange rate sensitive categories. However, business investment continues to be weighed down by cuts in resource sector spending. The labour market has been resilient at the national level, although with significant job losses in resource producing regions. The Bank expects GDP growth to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2015 before moving to a rate above potential in 2016. While bond yields are slightly higher, financial conditions remain accommodative in Canada. In the midst of all of these adjustments, inflation is in line with the Bank s October outlook. Total CPI inflation remains near the bottom of the Bank s target range, owing to declines in consumer energy prices. Core inflation is close to 2 per cent as the effects of the lower dollar and the output gap continue to offset each other. The Bank judges that the risks around the inflation profile remain roughly balanced over the projection horizon. Vulnerabilities in the household sector continue to edge higher while overall risks to financial stability are evolving as expected. Taking all of these developments into consideration, the Bank judges that the risks to the outlook for inflation remain within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Therefore, the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."
2016-01-20,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Inflation in Canada is evolving broadly as expected. Total CPI inflation remains near the bottom of the Bank s target range as the disinflationary effects of economic slack and low consumer energy prices are only partially offset by the inflationary impact of the lower Canadian dollar on the prices of imported goods. As all of these factors dissipate, the Bank expects inflation will rise to about 2 per cent by early 2017. Measures of core inflation should remain close to 2 per cent. The dynamics of the global economy are broadly as anticipated in the Bank s October Monetary Policy Report MPR , with diverging economic prospects and shifting terms of trade. China continues its transition to a more sustainable growth path and the expansion in the United States is on track, despite temporary weakness in the fourth quarter of 2015. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun to gradually withdraw its exceptional monetary stimulus. While risks to the world outlook remain and have been reflected in sharp price movements in a range of asset classes, global growth is expected to trend upwards beginning in 2016. Prices for oil and other commodities have declined further and this represents a setback for the Canadian economy. GDP growth likely stalled in the fourth quarter of 2015, pulled down by temporary softness in the U.S. economy, weaker business investment and several other temporary factors. The Bank now expects the economy s return to above potential growth to be delayed until the second quarter of 2016. The protracted process of reorientation towards non resource activity is underway, helped by stronger U.S. demand, the lower Canadian dollar, and accommodative monetary and financial conditions. National employment remains resilient despite job losses in the resource sector and household spending continues to expand. The Bank projects Canada s economy will grow by about 1 1/2 per cent in 2016 and 2 1/2 per cent in 2017. The complex nature of the ongoing structural adjustment makes the outlook for demand and potential output highly uncertain. The Bank s current base case projection shows the output gap closing later than was anticipated in October, around the end of 2017. However, the Bank has not yet incorporated the positive impact of fiscal measures expected in the next federal budget. All things considered, therefore, the risks to the profile for inflation are roughly balanced. Meanwhile, financial vulnerabilities continue to edge higher, as expected. The Bank s Governing Council judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate, and the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."
2016-03-09,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. The global economy is progressing largely as the Bank anticipated in its January Monetary Policy Report MPR . Financial market volatility, reflecting heightened concerns about economic momentum, appears to be abating. Although downside risks remain, the Bank still expects global growth to strengthen this year and next. Recent data indicate that the U.S. expansion remains broadly on track. At the same time, the low level of oil prices will continue to dampen growth in Canada and other energy producing countries. Prices of oil and other commodities have rebounded in recent weeks. In this context, and in light of shifting expectations for monetary policy in Canada and the United States, the Canadian dollar has appreciated from its recent lows. With these movements, both the price of oil and the exchange rate have averaged close to levels assumed in the January MPR. Canada s GDP growth in the fourth quarter was not as weak as expected, but the near term outlook for the economy remains broadly the same as in January. National employment has held up despite job losses in resource intensive regions, and household spending continues to underpin domestic demand. Non energy exports are gathering momentum, particularly in sectors that are sensitive to exchange rate movements. However, overall business investment remains very weak due to retrenchment in the resource sector. Inflation in Canada is evolving broadly as anticipated. The factors that pushed total CPI inflation up to 2 per cent will likely unwind in the months ahead. Measures of core inflation are at or just below 2 per cent, boosted by the temporary effects of past exchange rate depreciation. Material excess capacity in the Canadian economy will continue to dampen inflation. An assessment of the impact of the upcoming federal budget s fiscal measures will be incorporated into the Bank s April projection. All things considered, the risks to the profile for inflation are roughly balanced. Meanwhile, financial vulnerabilities continue to edge higher, in part due to regional shifts in activity associated with the structural adjustment underway in Canada s economy. The Bank s Governing Council judges that the overall balance of risks remains within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate, and the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."
2016-04-13,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Growth in the global economy is expected to strengthen gradually from about 3 per cent in 2016 to 3 1/2 per cent in 2017 18, a weaker outlook than the Bank had projected in its January Monetary Policy Report MPR . After a slow start to 2016, the US economy is expected to regain momentum, but with a lower profile and a composition that is less favourable for Canadian exports. Financial conditions have improved, partly in response to expectations of more accommodative monetary policy in some major economies. Prices of oil and other commodities are off their earlier lows and slightly above levels assumed by the Bank in January, but remain well below historical averages. Nonetheless, the Bank expects deeper cuts to investment in Canada s energy sector than were forecast in January. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar has firmed, reflecting shifting expectations for monetary policy in Canada and the United States, as well as recent increases in commodity prices. The Canadian economy s complex structural adjustment to the oil price shock is ongoing and will dampen growth throughout the Bank s projection horizon. First quarter GDP growth appears to have been unexpectedly strong, but some of that strength is due to temporary factors and is likely to reverse in the second quarter. Still, it does appear that the positive forces at work in the economy are starting to outweigh those that are negative. Non resource exports are expected to strengthen, but their profile is weaker than previously projected, in part because of slower foreign demand growth and the higher Canadian dollar. The economy continues to create net new employment, especially in services, despite job losses in resource intensive regions. In this context, household spending continues to expand moderately. While business investment is still shrinking due to sizeable declines in the energy sector, it is expected to turn positive later this year. The complex adjustment figures importantly in the Bank s annual review of the economy s potential, which has resulted in a lower estimated range for potential output growth. The combined effect of all of these global and domestic developments would have been a modest downgrade of the Bank s outlook. However, the fiscal measures announced in the March federal budget will have a notable positive impact on GDP. The Bank now projects real GDP growth of 1.7 per cent in 2016, 2.3 per cent in 2017 and 2.0 per cent in 2018. This new growth profile, combined with the revised estimate for potential, suggests the output gap could close somewhat earlier than the Bank had anticipated in January, likely in the second half of 2017. Inflation in Canada continues to track largely as the Bank anticipated. Total CPI inflation is below the 2 per cent target and will likely ease further before returning to 2 per cent as the effects of exchange rate pass through and lower consumer energy prices unwind and the economy s excess capacity diminishes. Measures of core inflation are close to 2 per cent and continue to reflect the offsetting influences of past exchange rate depreciation and excess capacity. Overall, the risks to the profile for inflation are roughly balanced. Meanwhile, financial vulnerabilities continue to edge higher, in part due to regional shifts in activity associated with the structural adjustment underway in Canada s economy. The Bank s Governing Council judges that the overall balance of risks remains within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate, and the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."
2016-05-25,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. The global economy is evolving largely as the Bank projected in its April Monetary Policy Report MPR . In the United States, despite weakness in the first quarter, a number of indicators, including employment, point to a return to solid growth in 2016. Financial conditions remain accommodative, with ongoing geopolitical factors contributing to fragile market sentiment. Oil prices are higher, in part because of short term supply disruptions. In Canada, the economy s structural adjustment to the oil price shock continues, but is proving to be uneven. Growth in the first quarter of 2016 appears to be in line with the Bank s April projection, although business investment and intentions remain disappointing. The second quarter will be much weaker than predicted because of the devastating Alberta wildfires. The Bank s preliminary assessment is that fire related destruction and the associated halt to oil production will cut about 1 1/4 percentage points off real GDP growth in the second quarter. The economy is expected to rebound in the third quarter, as oil production resumes and reconstruction begins. While the Canadian dollar has been fluctuating in response to shifting expectations of US monetary policy and higher oil prices, it is now close to the level assumed in April. Inflation is roughly in line with the Bank s expectations. Total CPI inflation has risen recently, largely due to movements in gasoline prices, but remains slightly below the 2 per cent target. Measures of core inflation remain close to 2 per cent, reflecting the offsetting influences of past exchange rate depreciation and excess capacity. Canada s housing market continues to display strong regional divergences, reinforced by the complex adjustment underway in the economy. In this context, household vulnerabilities have moved higher. Meanwhile, the risks to the Bank s inflation projection remain roughly balanced. Therefore, the Bank s Governing Council judges that the current stance of monetary policy is still appropriate, and the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."
2016-07-13,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Inflation in Canada is on track to return to 2 per cent in 2017 as the complex adjustment underway in Canada s economy proceeds. The fundamentals remain in place for a pickup in growth over the projection horizon, albeit in a climate of heightened uncertainty. In this context, the forecast for the global economy has been marked down slightly from the Bank s April Monetary Policy Report MPR . Global GDP growth is projected to be 2.9 per cent in 2016, 3.3 per cent in 2017, and 3.5 per cent in 2018. In particular, after a weak start to 2016 the US economy is showing signs of a rebound, with a healthy labour market and solid consumption growth. In the wake of Brexit, global markets have materially re priced a number of asset classes. Financial conditions, already accommodative, have become even more so. In Canada, the quarterly pattern of growth has been uneven. Real GDP grew by 2.4 per cent in the first quarter but is estimated to have contracted by 1 per cent in the second quarter, pulled down by volatile trade flows, uneven consumer spending, and the Alberta wildfires. A pick up to 3 1/2 per cent is expected in the third quarter as oil production resumes and rebuilding begins in Fort McMurray. Consumer spending will also get a boost from the Canada Child Benefit. While the fundamental elements of the Bank s projection are similar to those presented in April, the forecast has been revised down in light of a weaker outlook for business investment and a lower profile for exports, reflecting a downward adjustment to US investment spending. Real GDP is expected to grow by 1.3 per cent in 2016, 2.2 per cent in 2017, and 2.1 per cent in 2018. The Bank projects above potential growth from the second half of 2016, lifted by rising US demand and supported by accommodative monetary and financial conditions. Federal infrastructure spending and other fiscal measures announced in the March budget will also contribute to growth. Despite recent volatility, the Bank expects the underlying trend of export growth to continue, leading to a pick up in business investment. Higher global oil prices are helping to stabilize Canada s energy sector and household spending is expected to increase moderately. The Bank forecasts that the output gap will close somewhat later than estimated in April, towards the end of 2017. Underlying this judgement is the downward revision to business investment, which lowers the profile for both real GDP and, to a lesser extent, potential output. While inflation has recently been a little higher than anticipated, largely due to higher consumer energy prices, it is still in the lower half of the Bank s inflation control range. Most measures of core inflation remain close to 2 per cent but would be lower without the impact of past exchange rate depreciation. The temporary effects of exchange rate pass through and past declines in consumer energy prices are expected to dissipate in late 2016, and the Bank projects that inflation will average close to 2 per cent throughout 2017 as the output gap narrows. Overall, the risks to the profile for inflation are roughly balanced, although the implications of the Brexit vote are highly uncertain and difficult to forecast. At the same time, financial vulnerabilities are elevated and rising, particularly in the greater Vancouver and Toronto areas. The Bank s Governing Council judges that the overall balance of risks remains within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate, and the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."
2016-09-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Global growth in the first half of 2016 was slower than the Bank had projected in its July Monetary Policy Report MPR , although the Bank continues to expect it to strengthen gradually in the second half of this year. The US economy was weaker than expected in the second quarter, notably reflecting a contraction in business and residential investment. While a healthy labour market and solid consumption should remain supportive of growth in the rest of the year, the outlook for business investment has become less certain. Meanwhile, global financial conditions have become even more accommodative since July. While Canada s economy shrank in the second quarter, the Bank still projects a substantial rebound in the second half of this year. Second quarter GDP was pulled down by the Alberta wildfires in May and by a drop in exports that was larger and more broad based than expected. Exports disappointed even after accounting for weaker business and residential investment in the United States, adjustments in the resource sector, and cutbacks in auto production. The economy is expected to rebound in the third quarter as oil production recovers, rebuilding commences in Alberta, and consumer spending gets an additional lift from Canada Child Benefit payments. As federal infrastructure spending starts to have more impact, growth in the fourth quarter is projected to remain above potential. While the strength in exports during July was encouraging, the ground lost over previous months raises the possibility that the profile for economic activity will be somewhat lower than anticipated in July. Inflation is roughly in line with the Bank s expectations. Total CPI inflation is below the 2 per cent target, mainly because of the temporary effects of lower consumer energy prices. Measures of core inflation remain around 2 per cent, reflecting offsetting effects of excess capacity and past exchange rate depreciation. On balance, risks to the profile for inflation have tilted somewhat to the downside since July. At the same time, while there are preliminary signs of a possible moderation in the Vancouver housing market, financial vulnerabilities associated with household imbalances remain elevated and continue to rise. The Bank s Governing Council judges that the overall balance of risks remains within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate, and the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."
2016-10-19,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. The global economy is expected to regain momentum in the second half of this year and through 2017 and 2018. After a weak first half, the US economy in particular is strengthening solid consumption is being underpinned by strong employment growth and robust consumer confidence. However, because of elevated uncertainty, US business investment is on a lower track than expected. Looking through the choppiness of recent data, the profile for growth in Canada is now lower than projected in July s Monetary Policy Report MPR . This is due in large part to slower near term housing resale activity and a lower trajectory for exports. The federal government s new measures to promote stability in Canada s housing market are likely to restrain residential investment while dampening household vulnerabilities. Recent export data are improving but are not strong enough to make up for ground lost during the first half of 2016, despite the effects of the Canadian dollar s past depreciation. Growth in exports over 2017 and 2018 are projected to be slower than previously forecast, due to lower estimates of global demand, a composition of US growth that appears less favourable to Canadian exports, and ongoing competitiveness challenges for Canadian firms. After incorporating these weaker elements, Canada s economy is still expected to grow at a rate above potential starting in the second half of 2016, supported by accommodative monetary and financial conditions and federal fiscal measures. As the economy continues to adjust to the oil price shock, investment in the energy sector appears to be bottoming out. Non resource activity is growing solidly, particularly in the services sector. Household spending continues to rise, along with employment and incomes outside of energy intensive regions. The Bank expects Canada s real GDP to grow by 1.1 per cent in 2016 and about 2 per cent in both 2017 and 2018. This projection implies that the economy returns to full capacity around mid 2018, materially later than the Bank had anticipated in July. Measures of core inflation remain close to 2 per cent as the effects of past exchange rate depreciation and excess capacity continue to offset each other. Total CPI inflation is tracking slightly below expectations because of temporary weakness in prices for gasoline, food, and telecommunications. The Bank expects total CPI inflation to be close to 2 per cent from early 2017 onwards, when these temporary factors will have dissipated, but downward pressure on inflation will continue while economic slack persists. Given the downward revision to the growth profile and the later closing of the output gap, the Bank considers the risks around its updated inflation outlook to be roughly balanced, albeit in a context of heightened uncertainty. Meanwhile, the new housing measures should mitigate risks to the financial system over time. At present, the Bank s Governing Council judges that the overall balance of risks is still in the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate, and the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."
2016-12-07,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Economic data suggest that global economic conditions have strengthened, as the Bank anticipated in its October Monetary Policy Report MPR . However, uncertainty, which has been undermining business confidence and dampening investment in Canada s major trading partners, remains undiminished. Following the election in the United States, there has been a rapid back up in global bond yields, partly reflecting market anticipation of fiscal expansion in a US economy that is near full capacity. Canadian yields have risen significantly in this context. In Canada, the dynamics of growth are largely as the Bank anticipated. Following a very weak first half of 2016, growth in the third quarter rebounded strongly, but more moderate growth is anticipated in the fourth quarter. Consumption growth was robust in the third quarter, supported by the new Canada Child Benefit, while the effects of federal infrastructure spending are not yet evident in the GDP data. Meanwhile, business investment and non energy goods exports continue to disappoint. There have been ongoing gains in employment, but a significant amount of economic slack remains in Canada, in contrast to the United States. While household imbalances continue to rise, these will be mitigated over time by announced changes to housing finance rules. Total CPI inflation has picked up in recent months but is slightly below expectations, largely because of lower food prices. Core inflation is close to 2 per cent because the effect of persistent economic slack is still being offset by that of past exchange rate depreciation, although the latter effect is dissipating. Overall, the Bank s Governing Council judges that the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. Therefore, the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent."
2017-01-18,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Uncertainty about the global outlook is undiminished, particularly with respect to policies in the United States. The Bank has made initial assumptions about prospective tax policies only, resulting in a modest upward revision to its US growth outlook. Overall, the global economy is strengthening largely as expected and prices of some commodities, including oil, have risen. The rapid back up in global bond yields, partly reflecting market anticipation of US fiscal expansion, has pulled up Canadian yields relative to the October Monetary Policy Report MPR . In contrast to the United States, Canada s economy continues to operate with material excess capacity. While employment growth has remained firm, indicators still point to significant slack in the labour market. The resource sector s adjustment to past commodity price declines appears to be largely complete, but negative wealth and income effects will persist. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar has strengthened along with the US dollar against other currencies, exacerbating ongoing competitiveness challenges and muting the outlook for exports. Consumption is expected to remain solid, while residential investment will be tempered by previously announced changes to housing finance rules and by mortgage rates that have risen in response to higher bond yields. Federal and provincial fiscal measures are still expected to support growth in 2017. Bearing in mind the important assumptions embedded in its forecast, the Bank projects that Canada s real GDP will grow by 2.1 per cent in both 2017 and 2018. This implies a return to full capacity around mid 2018, in line with October s projection. Inflation in Canada has been lower than anticipated since October, mainly because of declines in food prices. Measures of core inflation are below 2 per cent, reflecting material excess capacity in the economy. As consumer energy prices rise and the impact of lower food prices dissipates, inflation is expected to move close to the 2 per cent target in the months ahead and remain there throughout the projection horizon while excess capacity is being absorbed. In the context of a projection that is largely unchanged, the Bank s Governing Council judges that the current stance of monetary policy is still appropriate and maintains the target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. Governing Council will continue to assess the impact of ongoing developments, mindful of the significant uncertainties weighing on the outlook."
2017-03-01,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. CPI inflation rose to 2.1 per cent in January, reflecting higher energy prices due in part to carbon pricing measures introduced in two provinces. The Bank is looking through these effects, as their impact on inflation will be temporary. The Bank s three measures of core inflation, taken together, continue to point to material excess capacity in the economy. Overall, recent data on the global and Canadian economies have been consistent with the Bank s projection of improving growth, as set out in the January Monetary Policy Report MPR . In Canada, recent consumption and housing indicators suggest growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 may have been slightly stronger than expected. However, exports continue to face the ongoing competitiveness challenges described in the January MPR. The Canadian dollar and bond yields remain near levels observed at that time. While there have been recent gains in employment, subdued growth in wages and hours worked continue to reflect persistent economic slack in Canada, in contrast to the United States. The Bank s Governing Council remains attentive to the impact of significant uncertainties weighing on the outlook and continues to monitor risks outlined in the January MPR. In this context, Governing Council judges that the current stance of monetary policy is still appropriate and maintains the target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent."
2017-04-12,"The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Global economic growth is strengthening and becoming more broadly based than the Bank had expected in its January Monetary Policy Report MPR , although there is still considerable uncertainty about the outlook. In the United States, some temporary factors weighed on economic activity in the first quarter but the drivers of growth remain solid. The US is close to full employment, unlike many other advanced economies, including Canada, where material slack remains. Global financial conditions remain accommodative. The Bank expects global GDP growth to increase from 3 1/4 per cent this year to about 3 1/2 per cent in 2018 and 2019. In Canada, recent data indicate that economic growth has been faster than was expected in the January MPR. Growth was temporarily boosted by a resumption of spending in the oil and gas sector and the effects of the Canada Child Benefit on consumer spending. Residential investment has also been stronger than expected. Employment data have been robust, although gains in hours worked are still soft. Meanwhile, export growth has been uneven in the face of ongoing competitiveness challenges. Further, despite a recent uptick in sentiment, business investment remains well below what could be expected at this stage in the recovery. Accordingly, while the recent rebound in GDP is encouraging, it is too early to conclude that the economy is on a sustainable growth path. During the rest of this year and into 2018 and 2019, growth in Canada is expected to moderate but remain above potential. At the same time, its composition is expected to broaden as the pace of household spending, especially residential investment, slows while the contributions from exports and business investment increase. The Bank now projects real GDP growth of 2 1/2 per cent in 2017 and just below 2 per cent in 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, the Bank has revised down its projection of potential growth, reflecting persistently weak investment. With this combination of a higher profile for economic activity and a lower profile for potential, the output gap is projected to close in the first half of 2018, a bit sooner than the Bank anticipated in January. CPI inflation is now at the 2 per cent target, largely because of the transitory effects of higher oil prices and carbon pricing measures in two provinces, as well as other temporary factors. The Bank s three measures of core inflation, on the other hand, have been drifting down in recent quarters and wage growth remains subdued, consistent with material excess capacity in the economy. CPI inflation is expected to dip in the months ahead, as the temporary factors unwind, and then return to 2 per cent later in the projection horizon as the output gap closes. The Bank s Governing Council acknowledges the strength of recent data, some of which is temporary, and is mindful of the significant uncertainties weighing on the outlook. In this context, Governing Council judges that the current stance of monetary policy is still appropriate and maintains the target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent."
2017-05-24,"The Bank of Canada is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent. Inflation is broadly in line with the Bank s projection in its April Monetary Policy Report MPR . Food prices continue to decline, mainly because of intense retail competition, pushing inflation temporarily lower. The Bank s three measures of core inflation remain below two per cent and wage growth is still subdued, consistent with ongoing excess capacity in the economy. The global economy continues to gain traction and recent developments reinforce the Bank s view that growth will gradually strengthen and broaden over the projection horizon. As anticipated, growth in the United States during the first quarter was weak, reflecting mostly temporary factors. Recent data point to a rebound in the second quarter. The uncertainties outlined in the April MPR continue to cloud the global and Canadian outlooks. The Canadian economy s adjustment to lower oil prices is largely complete and recent economic data have been encouraging, including indicators of business investment. Consumer spending and the housing sector continue to be robust on the back of an improving labour market, and these are becoming more broadly based across regions. Macroprudential and other policy measures, while contributing to more sustainable debt profiles, have yet to have a substantial cooling effect on housing markets. Meanwhile, export growth remains subdued, as anticipated in the April MPR, in the face of ongoing competitiveness challenges. The Bank s monitoring of the economic data suggests that very strong growth in the first quarter will be followed by some moderation in the second quarter. All things considered, Governing Council judges that the current degree of monetary stimulus is appropriate at present, and maintains the target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent."
2017-07-12,"The Bank of Canada is raising its target for the overnight rate to 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per cent. Recent data have bolstered the Bank s confidence in its outlook for above potential growth and the absorption of excess capacity in the economy. The Bank acknowledges recent softness in inflation but judges this to be temporary. Recognizing the lag between monetary policy actions and future inflation, Governing Council considers it appropriate to raise its overnight rate target at this time. The global economy continues to strengthen and growth is broadening across countries and regions. The US economy was tepid in the first quarter of 2017 but is now growing at a solid pace, underpinned by a robust labour market and stronger investment. Above potential growth is becoming more widespread in the euro area. However, elevated geopolitical uncertainty still clouds the global outlook, particularly for trade and investment. Meanwhile, world oil prices have softened as markets work toward a new supply/demand balance. Canada s economy has been robust, fuelled by household spending. As a result, a significant amount of economic slack has been absorbed. The very strong growth of the first quarter is expected to moderate over the balance of the year, but remain above potential. Growth is broadening across industries and regions and therefore becoming more sustainable. As the adjustment to lower oil prices is largely complete, both the goods and services sectors are expanding. Household spending will likely remain solid in the months ahead, supported by rising employment and wages, but its pace is expected to slow over the projection horizon. At the same time, exports should make an increasing contribution to GDP growth. Business investment should also add to growth, a view supported by the most recent Business Outlook Survey. The Bank estimates real GDP growth will moderate further over the projection horizon, from 2.8 per cent in 2017 to 2.0 per cent in 2018 and 1.6 per cent in 2019. The output gap is now projected to close around the end of 2017, earlier than the Bank anticipated in its April Monetary Policy Report MPR . CPI inflation has eased in recent months and the Bank s three measures of core inflation all remain below 2 per cent. The factors behind soft inflation appear to be mostly temporary, including heightened food price competition, electricity rebates in Ontario, and changes in automobile pricing. As the effects of these relative price movements fade and excess capacity is absorbed, the Bank expects inflation to return to close to 2 per cent by the middle of 2018. The Bank will continue to analyze short term inflation fluctuations to determine the extent to which it remains appropriate to look through them. Governing Council judges that the current outlook warrants today s withdrawal of some of the monetary policy stimulus in the economy. Future adjustments to the target for the overnight rate will be guided by incoming data as they inform the Bank s inflation outlook, keeping in mind continued uncertainty and financial system vulnerabilities."
2017-09-06,"The Bank of Canada is raising its target for the overnight rate to 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Recent economic data have been stronger than expected, supporting the Bank s view that growth in Canada is becoming more broadly based and self sustaining. Consumer spending remains robust, underpinned by continued solid employment and income growth. There has also been more widespread strength in business investment and in exports. Meanwhile, the housing sector appears to be cooling in some markets in response to recent changes in tax and housing finance policies. The Bank continues to expect a moderation in the pace of economic growth in the second half of 2017, for the reasons described in the July Monetary Policy Report MPR , but the level of GDP is now higher than the Bank had expected. The global economic expansion is becoming more synchronous, as anticipated in July, with stronger than expected indicators of growth, including higher industrial commodity prices. However, significant geopolitical risks and uncertainties around international trade and fiscal policies remain, leading to a weaker US dollar against many major currencies. In this context, the Canadian dollar has appreciated, also reflecting the relative strength of Canada s economy. While inflation remains below the 2 per cent target, it has evolved largely as expected in July. There has been a slight increase in both total CPI and the Bank s core measures of inflation, consistent with the dissipating negative impact of temporary price shocks and the absorption of economic slack. Nonetheless, there remains some excess capacity in Canada s labour market, and wage and price pressures are still more subdued than historical relationships would suggest, as observed in some other advanced economies. Given the stronger than expected economic performance, Governing Council judges that today s removal of some of the considerable monetary policy stimulus in place is warranted. Future monetary policy decisions are not predetermined and will be guided by incoming economic data and financial market developments as they inform the outlook for inflation. Particular focus will be given to the evolution of the economy s potential, and to labour market conditions. Furthermore, given elevated household indebtedness, close attention will be paid to the sensitivity of the economy to higher interest rates."
2017-10-25,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. Inflation has picked up in recent months, as anticipated in the Bank s July Monetary Policy Report MPR , reflecting stronger economic activity and higher gasoline prices. Measures of core inflation have edged up, in line with a narrowing output gap and the diminishing effects of lower food prices. The Bank projects inflation will rise to 2 per cent in the second half of 2018. This is a little later than anticipated in July because of the recent strength in the Canadian dollar. The Bank is also mindful that global structural factors could be weighing on inflation in Canada and other advanced economies. The global and Canadian economies are progressing as outlined in the July MPR. Economic activity continues to strengthen and broaden across countries. The Bank still expects global growth to average around 3 1/2 per cent over 2017 19. However, this outlook remains subject to substantial uncertainty about geopolitical developments and fiscal and trade policies, notably the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada s economic growth in the second quarter was stronger than expected, and was more broad based across regions and sectors. Growth is expected to moderate to a more sustainable pace in the second half of 2017 and remain close to potential over the next two years, with real GDP expanding at 3.1 per cent in 2017, 2.1 per cent in 2018 and 1.5 per cent in 2019. Exports and business investment are both expected to continue to make a solid contribution to GDP growth. However, projected export growth is slightly slower than before, in part because of a stronger Canadian dollar than assumed in July. Housing and consumption are forecast to slow in light of policy changes affecting housing markets and higher interest rates. Because of high debt levels, household spending is likely more sensitive to interest rates than in the past. The Bank estimates that the economy is operating close to its potential. However, wage and other data indicate that there is still slack in the labour market. This suggests that there could be room for more economic growth than the Bank is projecting without inflation rising materially above target. Based on this outlook and the risks and uncertainties identified in today s MPR, Governing Council judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. While less monetary policy stimulus will likely be required over time, Governing Council will be cautious in making future adjustments to the policy rate. In particular, the Bank will be guided by incoming data to assess the sensitivity of the economy to interest rates, the evolution of economic capacity, and the dynamics of both wage growth and inflation."
2017-12-06,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent. The global economy is evolving largely as expected in the Bank s October Monetary Policy Report MPR . In the United States, growth in the third quarter was stronger than forecast but is still expected to moderate in the months ahead. Growth has firmed in other advanced economies. Meanwhile, oil prices have moved higher and financial conditions have eased. The global outlook remains subject to considerable uncertainty, notably about geopolitical developments and trade policies. Recent Canadian data are in line with October s outlook, which was for growth to moderate while remaining above potential in the second half of 2017. Employment growth has been very strong and wages have shown some improvement, supporting robust consumer spending in the third quarter. Business investment continued to contribute to growth after a strong first half, and public infrastructure spending is becoming more evident in the data. Following exceptionally strong growth earlier in 2017, exports declined by more than was expected in the third quarter. However, the latest trade data support the MPR projection that export growth will resume as foreign demand strengthens. Housing has continued to moderate, as expected. Inflation has been slightly higher than anticipated and will continue to be boosted in the short term by temporary factors, particularly gasoline prices. Measures of core inflation have edged up in recent months, reflecting the continued absorption of economic slack. Revisions to past quarterly national accounts have resulted in a higher level of GDP. However, this is unlikely to have significant implications for the output gap because the revisions also imply a higher level of potential output. Meanwhile, despite rising employment and participation rates, other indicators point to ongoing albeit diminishing slack in the labour market. Based on the outlook for inflation and the evolution of the risks and uncertainties identified in October s MPR, Governing Council judges that the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. While higher interest rates will likely be required over time, Governing Council will continue to be cautious, guided by incoming data in assessing the economy s sensitivity to interest rates, the evolution of economic capacity, and the dynamics of both wage growth and inflation."
2018-01-17,"The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent. Recent data have been strong, inflation is close to target, and the economy is operating roughly at capacity. However, uncertainty surrounding the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA is clouding the economic outlook. The global economy continues to strengthen, with growth expected to average 3 1/2 per cent over the projection horizon. Growth in advanced economies is projected to be stronger than in the Bank s October Monetary Policy Report MPR . In particular, there are signs of increasing momentum in the US economy, which will be boosted further by recent tax changes. Global commodity prices are higher, although the benefits to Canada are being diluted by wider spreads between benchmark world and Canadian oil prices. In Canada, real GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.2 per cent in 2018 and 1.6 per cent in 2019, following an estimated 3.0 per cent in 2017. Growth is expected to remain above potential through the first quarter of 2018 and then slow to a rate close to potential for the rest of the projection horizon. Consumption and residential investment have been stronger than anticipated, reflecting strong employment growth. Business investment has been increasing at a solid pace, and investment intentions remain positive. Exports have been weaker than expected although, apart from cross border shifts in automotive production, there have been positive signs in most other categories. Looking forward, consumption and residential investment are expected to contribute less to growth, given higher interest rates and new mortgage guidelines, while business investment and exports are expected to contribute more. The Bank s outlook takes into account a small benefit to Canada s economy from stronger US demand arising from recent tax changes. However, as uncertainty about the future of NAFTA is weighing increasingly on the outlook, the Bank has incorporated into its projection additional negative judgement on business investment and trade. The Bank continues to monitor the extent to which strong demand is boosting potential, creating room for more non inflationary expansion. In this respect, capital investment, firm creation, labour force participation, and hours worked are all showing promising signs. Recent data show that labour market slack is being absorbed more quickly than anticipated. Wages have picked up but are rising by less than would be typical in the absence of labour market slack. In this context, inflation is close to 2 per cent and core measures of inflation have edged up, consistent with diminishing slack in the economy. The Bank expects CPI inflation to fluctuate in the months ahead as various temporary factors including gasoline and electricity prices unwind. Looking through these temporary factors, inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent over the projection horizon. While the economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to keep the economy operating close to potential and inflation on target. Governing Council will remain cautious in considering future policy adjustments, guided by incoming data in assessing the economy s sensitivity to interest rates, the evolution of economic capacity, and the dynamics of both wage growth and inflation."
2018-03-07,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent. Global growth remains solid and broad based. In the United States, new government spending and previously announced tax cuts are anticipated to boost growth in 2018 and 2019. However, trade policy developments are an important and growing source of uncertainty for the global and Canadian outlooks. In Canada, the national accounts data show that the economy grew by 3 per cent in 2017, bringing the level of real GDP in line with the projection in the Bank s January Monetary Policy Report MPR . In the fourth quarter, GDP growth was slower than expected, largely due to higher imports, while exports made only a partial recovery from their third quarter decline. The gain in imports mainly reflected stronger business investment, which adds to the economy s capacity. Strong housing data in late 2017, and softer data at the beginning of this year, indicate some pulling forward of demand ahead of new mortgage guidelines and other policy measures. It will take some time to fully assess the impact of these, as well as recently announced provincial measures, on housing demand and prices. More broadly, the Bank continues to monitor the economy s sensitivity to higher interest rates. Notably, household credit growth has decelerated for three consecutive months. The implications of the recent federal budget for the outlook for growth and inflation will be incorporated in the Bank s April projection. Inflation is running close to the 2 per cent target and the Bank s core measures of inflation have edged up, consistent with an economy operating near capacity. Wage growth has firmed, but remains lower than would be typical in an economy with no labour market slack. Inflation is fluctuating because of temporary factors related to gasoline, electricity, and minimum wages. In this context, Governing Council maintained the target for the overnight rate at 1 1/4 per cent. While the economic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to keep the economy operating close to potential and inflation on target. Governing Council will remain cautious in considering future policy adjustments, guided by incoming data in assessing the economy s sensitivity to interest rates, the evolution of economic capacity, and the dynamics of both wage growth and inflation."
2018-04-18,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent. Inflation in Canada is close to 2 per cent as temporary factors that have been weighing on inflation have largely dissipated, as expected. Consistent with an economy operating with little slack, core measures of inflation have continued to edge up and are all now close to 2 per cent. The transitory impact of higher gasoline prices and recent minimum wage increases will likely cause inflation in 2018 to be modestly higher than the Bank expected in its January Monetary Policy Report MPR , returning to the 2 per cent target for the rest of the projection horizon. The global economy is on a modestly stronger track than forecast in January, with upward revisions to growth and potential output in a number of major advanced economies. The outlook for the U.S. economy has been further boosted by new government spending plans. However, escalating geopolitical and trade conflicts risk undermining the global expansion. In Canada, GDP growth in the first quarter was weaker than the Bank had expected, but should rebound in the second quarter, resulting in 2 per cent average growth in the first half of 2018. The economy is projected to operate slightly above its potential over the next three years, with real GDP growth of about 2 per cent in both 2018 and 2019, and 1.8 per cent in 2020. This stronger profile for GDP incorporates new provincial and federal fiscal measures announced since January. It also reflects upward revisions to estimates of potential output growth, which suggest the Canadian economy has made some progress in building capacity. Slower economic growth in the first quarter primarily reflects weakness in two areas. Housing markets responded to new mortgage guidelines and other policy measures by pulling forward transactions to late 2017. Exports also faltered, partly owing to transportation bottlenecks. Some of the weakness in housing and exports is expected to be unwound as 2018 progresses. The Bank anticipates that Canadian exports will strengthen as foreign demand increases, but not sufficiently to recover the ground lost during recent quarters. Export growth is being increasingly limited by capacity constraints in some sectors. Continued gains in business investment should build additional capacity in those sectors and in the economy more generally. However, both exports and investment are being held back by ongoing competitiveness challenges and uncertainty about trade policies. Growth in consumption remains robust, supported by strong labour income growth. Wages have continued to pick up as expected, even after factoring out recent minimum wage increases in Ontario and Alberta. The Bank will continue to assess labour market data for signs of remaining slack. Some progress has been made on the key issues being watched closely by Governing Council, particularly the dynamics of inflation and wage growth. This progress reinforces Governing Council s view that higher interest rates will be warranted over time, although some monetary policy accommodation will still be needed to keep inflation on target. The Bank will also continue to monitor the economy s sensitivity to interest rate movements and the evolution of economic capacity. In this context, Governing Council will remain cautious with respect to future policy adjustments, guided by incoming data."
2018-05-30,"The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent. Global economic activity remains broadly on track with the Bank s April Monetary Policy Report MPR forecast. Recent data point to some upside to the outlook for the US economy. At the same time, ongoing uncertainty about trade policies is dampening global business investment and stresses are developing in some emerging market economies. Global oil prices have been higher than assumed in April, in part reflecting geopolitical developments. Inflation in Canada has been close to the 2 per cent target and will likely be a bit higher in the near term than forecast in April, largely because of recent increases in gasoline prices. Core measures of inflation remain near 2 per cent, consistent with an economy operating close to potential. As usual, the Bank will look through the transitory impact of fluctuations in gasoline prices. In Canada, economic data since the April MPR have, on balance, supported the Bank s outlook for growth around 2 per cent in the first half of 2018. Activity in the first quarter appears to have been a little stronger than projected. Exports of goods were more robust than forecast, and data on imports of machinery and equipment suggest continued recovery in investment. Housing resale activity has remained soft into the second quarter, as the housing market continues to adjust to new mortgage guidelines and higher borrowing rates. Going forward, solid labour income growth supports the expectation that housing activity will pick up and consumption will continue to contribute importantly to growth in 2018. Overall, developments since April further reinforce Governing Council s view that higher interest rates will be warranted to keep inflation near target. Governing Council will take a gradual approach to policy adjustments, guided by incoming data. In particular, the Bank will continue to assess the economy s sensitivity to interest rate movements and the evolution of economic capacity."
2018-07-11,"The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1 per cent. The Bank expects the global economy to grow by about 3 per cent in 2018 and 3 per cent in 2019, in line with the April Monetary Policy Report MPR . The US economy is proving stronger than expected, reinforcing market expectations of higher policy rates and pushing up the US dollar. This is contributing to financial stresses in some emerging market economies. Meanwhile, oil prices have risen. Yet, the Canadian dollar is lower, reflecting broad based US dollar strength and concerns about trade actions. The possibility of more trade protectionism is the most important threat to global prospects. Canada s economy continues to operate close to its capacity and the composition of growth is shifting. Temporary factors are causing volatility in quarterly growth rates the Bank projects a pick up to 2.8 per cent in the second quarter and a moderation to 1.5 per cent in the third. Household spending is being dampened by higher interest rates and tighter mortgage lending guidelines. Recent data suggest housing markets are beginning to stabilize following a weak start to 2018. Meanwhile, exports are being buoyed by strong global demand and higher commodity prices. Business investment is growing in response to solid demand growth and capacity pressures, although trade tensions are weighing on investment in some sectors. Overall, the Bank still expects average growth of close to 2 per cent over 2018 2020. CPI and the Bank s core measures of inflation remain near 2 per cent, consistent with an economy operating close to capacity. CPI inflation is expected to edge up further to about 2.5 per cent before settling back to 2 per cent by the second half of 2019. The Bank estimates that underlying wage growth is running at about 2.3 per cent, slower than would be expected in a labour market with no slack. As in April, the projection incorporates an estimate of the impact of trade uncertainty on Canadian investment and exports. This effect is now judged to be larger, given mounting trade tensions. The July projection also incorporates the estimated impact of tariffs on steel and aluminum recently imposed by the United States, as well as the countermeasures enacted by Canada. Although there will be difficult adjustments for some industries and their workers, the effect of these measures on Canadian growth and inflation is expected to be modest. Governing Council expects that higher interest rates will be warranted to keep inflation near target and will continue to take a gradual approach, guided by incoming data. In particular, the Bank is monitoring the economy s adjustment to higher interest rates and the evolution of capacity and wage pressures, as well as the response of companies and consumers to trade actions."

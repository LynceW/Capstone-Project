2000/10/5,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions:              The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75%, starting from the operation to be settled on 11 October 2000.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference  starting at 2.30 p.m. today."
2000/8/31,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions:              The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 4.50%, starting from the operation to be settled on 6 September 2000.         The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 5.50%, with effect from 1 September 2000.         The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 3.50%, with effect from 1 September 2000.               The Governing Council is of the view that economic growth conditions and prospects in the euro area are very favourable. In order to maintain this benign environment, price stability over the medium term must be ensured. While present conditions are largely influenced by oil price and exchange rate developments and cannot be remedied by monetary policy in the short term, it is imperative that medium-term upward pressure on prices be contained. Today's policy decisions support the favourable prospects for high economic growth in the euro area.     In the context of the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, although the measures taken since November 1999 are gradually feeding their way through, the latest available information indicates that M3 growth has continued to deviate on the upside from the reference value of 4?%. At the same time, the expansion of credit to the private sector, at around 10%, suggests that households and firms regard financing conditions in the euro area as being very favourable. In the context of the robust expansion of economic activity, a continuation of ample liquidity conditions would constitute a risk to price stability.     Developments in key indicators related to the second pillar point in the same direction. The protracted depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro and the renewed rise in oil prices have increasingly put upward pressure on import prices and consumer prices in the euro area. At the same time, recent data have confirmed that the euro area has entered a period of strong growth and that the outlook remains very positive.     The Governing Council will continue to ensure that price stability is maintained in the euro area and will remain alert to all emerging risks to price stability. At the same time, it stresses that both sound public finances, in particular strict adherence to the criteria laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact, and the continuation of structural measures to enhance the flexibility of labour and goods markets will be the key to a lasting increase in the growth potential of the euro area."
2000/8/3,"At today's meeting, which was held in the form of a teleconference, the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 4.25%, 5.25% and 3.25% respectively."
2000/7/20,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 4.25%, 5.25% and 3.25% respectively."

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference  starting at 2.30 p.m. today."
2000/6/21,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 5.25% and 3.25% respectively.     As announced on 8 June 2000, the forthcoming main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be conducted as variable rate tenders, applying the multiple rate auction procedure, with a minimum bid rate of 4.25%. This rate is the same as that which prevailed for the two fixed rate tender operations settled on 15 and 21 June 2000.     The Governing Council also decided that, for the longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted in the second half of 2000, the Eurosystem intends to allot an amount of EUR 15 billion per operation. This amount takes into consideration the expected liquidity needs of the banking system of the euro area in the second half of 2000 and the desire of the Eurosystem to continue to provide the bulk of its refinancing of the financial sector through its main refinancing operations."
2000/6/8,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions:              The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 4.25% and applied in the two operations (which will be conducted as fixed rate tenders) to be settled on 15 and 21 June 2000.        The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 5.25% with effect from 9 June 2000.        The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 3.25%, with effect from 9 June 2000.        Starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be conducted as variable rate tenders, applying the multiple rate auction procedure. The Governing Council has decided to set a minimum bid rate for these operations equal to 4.25%. This is the same rate as that which will prevail for the two fixed rate tenders to be implemented following today's decision.               The switch to variable rate tenders in the main refinancing operations is not intended as a further change in the monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem. The new tender mechanism is a response to the severe overbidding which has developed in the context of the current fixed rate tender procedure. For the purpose of signalling the monetary policy stance, the minimum bid rate is designed to play the role performed, until now, by the rate in fixed rate tenders. This change does not in any way rule out the option that, in the future, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem may be conducted in principle as fixed rate tenders.     The time available until implementation of the new tender procedure as from the first main refinancing operation of the maintenance period starting on 24 June 2000 will help counterparties to prepare for the change.     In accordance with Article 8 of the Regulation (EC) No. 2818/98 of the European Central Bank of 1 December 1998 on the application of minimum reserves (ECB/1998/15), the marginal interest rate of the main refinancing operation is used to calculate the remuneration of required reserves.     The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference  starting at 2.30 p.m. today."
2000/5/25,"At today's meeting (which was held in the form of a teleconference), the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 3.75%, 4.75% and 2.75% respectively."
2000/5/11,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 3.75%, 4.75% and 2.75% respectively.     The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference  starting at 2.30 p.m. today."
2000/4/27,"Following the regular examination of the outlook for price developments in the euro area on the basis of the latest information on monetary, financial and other economic developments, the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions at today's meeting:              The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 3.75%, starting from the operation to be settled on 4 May 2000.        The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75%, with effect from 28 April 2000.        The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75%, with effect from 28 April 2000.               With today's decision, the Governing Council of the ECB continues its policy of reacting to upside risks to price stability in the medium term in a pre-emptive manner. In this way, monetary policy provides the best contribution to ensuring the sustainability of the current phase of strong and non-inflationary economic growth.     In its discussions the Governing Council confirmed the assessment which was presented by the President of the ECB in his introductory statement at the press conference after the Governing Council meeting on 13 April, as well as in the following issue of the ECB Monthly Bulletin. In particular, the Governing Council expressed concern about upside risks to price stability which, given the prospects for strong economic expansion, arise from strong growth in monetary and credit aggregates, as well as from the present level of the exchange rate of the euro.     The Governing Council discussed recent movements in the exchange rates between the major currencies, including the recent decline of the euro, and examined their possible implications for price stability in the euro area. The ECB judges that the present level of the euro does not reflect the strong economic fundamentals of the euro area."
2000/4/13,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 3.5%, 4.5% and 2.5% respectively.     The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2.30 p.m. today."
2000/3/30,"At today's meeting, which was held in Madrid, the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 3.5%, 4.5% and 2.5% respectively."
2000/3/16,"At today's meeting (which was also attended by the President of the European Commission, Mr. R. Prodi) the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions:              The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 3.5%, starting from the operation to be settled on 22 March 2000.        The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 4.5%, with effect from 17 March 2000.        The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 2.5%, with effect from 17 March 2000.               Following the regular examination of the outlook for price developments in the euro area on the basis of the latest information on monetary, financial and other economic developments, the Governing Council confirmed the assessment which was presented by the President of the ECB in his introductory statement at the press conference after the Governing Council meeting on 2 March 2000, as well as in the following issue of the ECB Monthly Bulletin. As noted there, economic conditions and prospects for the euro area appear to be better at present than at any time in the past decade. At the same time, upside risks to price stability were seen as a reason for vigilance. Today's decision addresses these upside risks, thereby contributing to maintaining the favourable outlook for the euro area economy.     With regard to the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, the prolonged deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of 4 1/2% points to the existence of ample liquidity in the euro area, especially when seen in conjunction with the continued strong growth of credit granted to the private sector.     Considering the second pillar, most indicators and forecasts point to increasing upward pressures on consumer price inflation over the medium term. The strong rise in oil prices and the downward movement of the exchange rate of the euro in the past are putting upward pressure on import costs and producer prices. In the context of a strong cyclical upswing, there is a risk that these developments could, via second round effects, have lasting effects on consumer price inflation.     Today's increase in ECB interest rates follows the interest rate decisions taken on 4 November 1999 and 3 February 2000 and continues the policy of countering these emerging upside risks to price stability in a timely and pre-emptive manner. By ensuring a non-inflationary environment, this move will contribute to ensuring sustainable economic growth in the euro area."

Differently from what was communicated in an announcement at 3.30 p.m. today, this change in the minimum bid rate will be effective starting from tomorrow's operation, which is to be settled on 19 September 2001. A new announcement with the revised rates is also being transmitted through wire services.        The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be reduced by 0.50 percentage point to 4.75%, with effect from 18 September 2001.        The interest rate on the deposit facility will be reduced by 0.50 percentage point to 2.75%, with effect from 18 September 2001.                 In the view of the Governing Council, the recent events in the US are likely to weigh adversely on confidence in the euro area, reducing the short-term outlook for domestic growth. As this is likely to further reduce inflationary risks in the euro area, a lowering of the ECB's key interest rates is appropriate. The Governing Council has confidence in the fundamental strength and resilience of the US economic system. Against the background of the sound fundamentals of the euro area, the Governing Council remains confident that the slowdown in economic growth will be short-lived."
2001/9/13,"The Governing Council of the ECB expresses its deep grief at the unprecedented and tragic events of terrorism which occurred in the United States. It offers its deepest sympathy and condolences to all those affected by these dreadful acts. The fundamental strength and resilience of the US economic system will not be impaired by recent events.     At today's meeting the Governing Council decided that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 4.25%, 5.25% and 3.25% respectively.     The Governing Council will carefully monitor further developments in the US and the world economy.     The Governing Council reconfirms that the Eurosystem stands ready to support the normal functioning of markets. In this context, the Eurosystem has conducted liquidity-providing fine tuning operations yesterday and today. While the expectation is that normal market conditions will prevail in the period ahead, the Eurosystem will continue to monitor developments in financial markets and take action if necessary. The Eurosystem is co-ordinating its activity with the Federal Reserve System of the United States and other major central banks of the world."

2008/10/8,"Throughout the current financial crisis, central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets.      Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of countries, partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices. Inflation expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability. The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability.      Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted. Accordingly, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing reductions in policy interest rates. The Bank of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions.      The Governing Council of the ECB, by means of teleconferencing, has taken the following monetary policy decisions:                The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be reduced by 50 basis points to 3.75 %, with effect from the main refinancing operation to be settled on 15 October 2008.        The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be reduced by 50 basis points to 4.75 %, with immediate effect.        The interest rate on the deposit facility will be reduced by 50 basis points to 2.75 %, with immediate effect.                 In the euro area, upside inflationary risks have recently decreased further. It remains imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. Keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with our objective and securing price stability in the medium term will support sustainable growth and employment and contribute to financial stability.

If, in the meantime, the outlook becomes less favourable or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation, the Governing Council intends to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP.

2018/6/14,"At today¡¯s meeting, which was held in Riga, the Governing Council of the ECB undertook a careful review of the progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, also taking into account the latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, measures of price and wage pressures, and uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook. Based on this review the Governing Council made the following decisions:  First, as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council will continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of ?30 billion until the end of September 2018. The Governing Council anticipates that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming the Governing Council¡¯s medium-term inflation outlook, the monthly pace of the net asset purchases will be reduced to ?15 billion until the end of December 2018 and that net purchases will then end. Second, the Governing Council intends to maintain its policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Third, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with the current expectations of a sustained adjustment path. Today¡¯s monetary policy decisions maintain the current ample degree of monetary accommodation that will ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
